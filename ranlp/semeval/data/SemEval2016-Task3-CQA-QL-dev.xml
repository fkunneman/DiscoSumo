			<RelCText>The best bank in Qatar for you would be the one that fits in your requirements.I suggest you visit the major banks here; and approach the Customer Relations person there to guide you with the facilities the bank offers. They include: -Current Accounts facilities -Savings Account facilities - Money Transfer (However; I highly recommend using the bank transfer only in emergency cases. There are money transfer agents which offer better exchange rates; and lower service fees) - Tie-ups with any bank in your home country to ease transfers</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Seems like all the banks need the salary to be credited to their accounts [where I came from that was not a necessity]. So it sort of limits my choices. Can anyone recommend me a bank that has good interest rates on loans and credit cards? So far I'm considering Doha Bank because of the Lulu card. Is it worth it? :)</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>If your salary is QR35K or more you can opt for QNB with their QNB First facility which allows you to use the airport lounges around the world; a faciltiy which comes in handy when travelling economy class. Also using their Master Card (credit card) gets you miles with Qatar Airways which you can use for travel. And there services in last 5 years of my being a customer has been excellent.

			<RelCText>Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've heard good reviews of Doha Bank CC. I have a platinium CC from CBQ. I used to earn miles with QA but they stopped the same from last year. They still charge me QAR 500 . Customer service tell me to enrol in some wafa points but both the website and contact number of wafa do not work if i wish to enrol. Awesome. QAR 500 bucks for a useless silver card - sorry platinium.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well Arman; nothing is wrong here with banks; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank; but I have made an extensive review of QIB; IBQ; QNB and CBQ. I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship. Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them.</RelCText>

I went to one and talked to the 'customer relationship officer' about opening an account and to each one of my question; he had to guess an answer :) any how; i guess only experience will tell. ------------------------------------------ Quidquid latine dictum sit; altum sonatur.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was catching fish before on corniche and if i show you some of the photos you would not believe me. Now everything on Corniche is banned. No Fishing; No Playing Football; No Bikes; No setting on the grass and ... I don't know what is next. You can go to 'Khour El Edid' and see there. Actually on those open places there is no guarantee all the time. Even the area near the Ritz Carlton that we were going there before like 7 years [we were fulling 2 big Coleman Fridges which comes sometimes 12KG] it is now band. Good luck and if you know a new place; plz tell me. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>From what you all have said; Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore; to enjoy and witness its natural reserves. Thanks for the share! I'm really waiting and seeking for answers of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure. hawaii snorkeling tours</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Reliable and honest garages in Doha.</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Can anyone recommend a reliable garage that is also low priced? I have been around the industrial area but its hard to know who is reliable and who is not. The best way is if i hear from the experience of the QatarLiving members. I am looking to do some work on my land cruiser.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>No Mr. Lincoln! its not a wiper fluid refill. Mechanically i am looking only at changing the timing belt and the axel boots in the front. I am keen to do cosmetic work on the cruiser. Complete body re-paint and polish...but i am looking for someone who does a really really neat job. Most of the paint shops out there just want to get the job done and are not overly concerned about the quality. As a customer; my top concern is the quality and finishing. Any suggestions guys? Any phone numbers would be appreciated. cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"my few experience : 1) I had noise on my Honda steering; plus steering was hard; i visited one mechanic in industrial area; he asked for QAR 400 for fixing... then i went to another mechanic; he asked for QAR 1500 ! said; i need to replace the entire unit including some belts (?)... then i went to third mechanic; and he found it was nothing... just power steering oil was to fill. and he fixed it in just 2 minutes and i was very happy to pay him QAR 50. my cost was dropped from 1500 to 50 Riyals ! 2) another incident; the vehicle was giving noise while putting in reverse gear. I went to the same mechanic who earlier had fixed steering problem just in 2 minute; and he asked for some checkup in German Computer. I did the checkup and computer gave an error code with description ""reverse solenoid blaa blaa blaa"". I presented the report to him; he said; the gearbox has to open and replace some switch inside and asked for the spare part from Honda + 500 Riyals for labour charge and 2 days tim....."</RelCText>

Nearly impossible to get into now if you don’t have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar.

			<RelCText>Why there? I have enjoyed many visits to the island; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy. I could be wrong; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future. On the flip side; the island is man made. So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport; and this is probably it. In which case; the owners can do what they like with their island. Well there ya go; I have answered my own question.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."</RelCText>

Where can we do this? Do you have an address/prices/telephone numbers? Where is the Qatar Bowling Center? Never heard of its existence... Hope to hear from you! Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>go to Carrefour/Jarir or any large bookstore/supermarket and buy a copy of Marhaba. In it is a list of all activities going on in Qatar along with all the phone numbers. There you can find out dunebashing companies; Where Qatar Bowling Center is (near Mannai RAB); the phone # for paintball at Villagio. The different places like sheraton and Diplomatic club that rent boats/ jetskis etc. It literally has HUNDREDS of listings and is only 20QR. I use mine all the time.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was catching fish before on corniche and if i show you some of the photos you would not believe me. Now everything on Corniche is banned. No Fishing; No Playing Football; No Bikes; No setting on the grass and ... I don't know what is next. You can go to 'Khour El Edid' and see there. Actually on those open places there is no guarantee all the time. Even the area near the Ritz Carlton that we were going there before like 7 years [we were fulling 2 big Coleman Fridges which comes sometimes 12KG] it is now band. Good luck and if you know a new place; plz tell me. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Like Dracula said; buy; dont rent...but for that price; you can go to Obeidly (in Sofitel)...but i think they have older cars. Some running alright but i would avoid them. They do have some good prices on the newer cars though. Just dont rent from Petra. They have lousy cars and they rip their clients off. The charge their credit cards without consent and then refuse to help settle the issue.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here; what nationality are you? If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>I have been offered a teaching post in Doha. An apartment will be provided along with medical cover and a few other benefits such as travel to work each day.

			<RelCText>Hello dear; I am not sure what to tell you but each one of us is looking for something different and also in a different situation; the short answer is No unless you are here to join a family member or planing on staying here for few month till something else open up; Qatar is relatively expensive compared to many close by destinations but it could be decent and moderate for those who know how to save; wish u best of luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The rule of thumb for expat salaries is your salary in the US/UK plus 25% plus housing; transportation; medical; air tickets; etc. Please realize there isn't public transportation per se in Qatar.

			<RelCText>The one thing you can be certain of is that Cairo is not Doha!!! We are talking about a city of over 12million where the traffic is so bad (if you think Doha is bad...just wait) its actually comical. There is also no system and it is one of the most frustrating places to live in. Hope you are based in Zamalek or Maadi which are the nicest parts. But the lack of a system and the 'pushiness' of the egyptians will make you angry and frustrated.The poverty is also striking. And yet; and yet; in one street of Cairo you will find more charm; more magic and more life than the whole of Doha. It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself (not surprising given its ancient history). It has the soul which Doha so lacks and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustrations. Egypt is a beguiling country which captured the heart of more than one roman emperor and many kings. Keep that in mind as you deal with the settling in period and once you .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for your responses. Celestvile; sounds like all the expat community lives in Maadi; and whilst I have heard that it is a quiet area with lots of greenery; I doubt it's convinient for us to live there as it is quite a ride from Giza; where my husband works. We shall see...we heard 6 October area is also nice? Besides; our housing allowance will only be $1500; which I think doesn't strech for a place in Maadi; and after living in a small flat for the last three years; I'm looking forward to a big place with a garden. By the way; do you have any idea where the french school is located? Dweller; oh god; now you worried me...with that kind of money I could live anywhere . Wonder why your son didn't like it. PM; yes I noticed that too (The $ sign); sounds like I will get ripped off quite often; then. So your friends dislike living in Cairo?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks; how awesome; I was thinking it was more like 1.5 hours from what everyone has said about Doha traffic!! :) Being here in the USA is a bit difficult to find out what areas are best to live in Doha... My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from? Are shoping areas and restaurants nearby already finished? Thanks so much! Kiki</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Qatar's property development websites are misleading as most of Qatar itself. What you see is not what you'll get. Lusail is a ""planned new city"" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel. A friendly advice: be prepared for the biggest frustrations you ever experienced at professional and social levels and you won't be disappointed. I wish you all the best!"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I am not actually in Doha yet myself; arriving at the end of this month. The only vehcile imports I have done in Doha previously was for the Oilfield Market; and is done slightly differently. You might be surprised; I seen a couple of big bike shops here in Doha when I visted a few weeks back. Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha. (Someone can correct me if I am wrong) PM me if you need further information; I do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the ins and outs if required. Have.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My husband is a life-long motorcycle junkie. Got his first when he was about 10 years old. He would never consider riding one here in Doha. Traffic is very dangerous. They have the highest accident rate per capita in the entire world. Check out some you-tube videos showing all the spectacular car crashes in Doha. You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>For a skilled worker from philippines - the normal basic salary is ranging from QR 2;500 to 5;000 excluding housing and transpo allowances. For professionals - salary is ranging from QR 8;000 to 45;000 depending on the qualification and industry. I know some colleagues in oil &amp; gas; banking industry and investments are even receiving between QR 50k to 80k per month. So it all depends on your qualification and work experiences.

			<RelCText>Frankly speaking the salary offered to you is a meager one if Doha standard of living is concerned. For your food alone you have to shell out at least 800 riyals per month. Your personal needs is an additional cost of 200 riyals. So total you'll have a net salary of 2000 riyals or about 500 dlrs. Socializing is another strain in your pocket. But it's okay as long as you follow the good manners and right conduct of being a foreigner here. No public display of affection and you must dress up modestly. If you think 2000 riyals is enough savings for you then good luck and welcome to Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>QP offer negotiation</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi all; I've finally received the official offer from QP and I think I'm being lowballed. The offer is QR23;000 + 14;200 housing and school and benefits. They put me in grade 16. I don't know anything about these grades. Can anyone enlight me and tell me also how much I can negotiate? I read some mixed discussions about the leeway I have for negotiation. I was expecting QR35;000 basic; realistic?. Thx in advance</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>35;000 is out of reach for grade 16; however; there is always a room for negotiation provided that you afford risking the job as they aren't normally that keen have a particular applicant for the job.

			<RelCText>Realisticly you are making $6;300 per month; with paid accommodation and free children's education etc etc. I don't see how you are being low balled when the majority of your basic income is going to be savings because your overheads are being paid for by QP already. Even if your current job position you are making more then $6300; the chances of saving anything are highly unlikely. Also remember their are promotions; yearly appraisals and the big fat bonus's every year. If you do the annual gross income on your basic salary with the above you could be pulling easily 28;000-30;000 per month :) Don't miss this opportunity!! Most ppl on QL dream to have a offer like this!! Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Normally QP does not negotiate packages; it is either you take it or leave it. They have hundreds of applicants looking to join QP. That salary is a lower end of grade 16. Normally there is no promotion in QP unless you are a Qatari or someone within GCC and you do get bonuses depending on your rating. Your annual bonus for an everage rating on your salary is around 34000 QAR and after 4 years you get 6000 QAR furniture maintenance annually. On top of the salary they will give you an expatriate allowance of about 3000 per month depending on which european country you come from and a car allowance of QAR 2000.00 per month. So basically its not bad.</RelCText>

US/UK schools here will cost you north of QAR 40K annually....and that is for PRE-K !!!! As to whether they are low-balling you;maybe. But without knowing details of your qualifications;current pay etc its hard to tell.Take into consideration the point I've made about schooling expense and those made by others on this thread. That said; I will say there is always room for a counter-offer.Just be smart with the number you go backto them with.Also depends on how much of a hard-ass the person you are dealing with is and at this point;I would imagine you have some idea.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you're going to be the office tea boy - it's magnificent. If you are a professional (engineer) with years of experience and a senior management position; it's garbage. One note - school fees and housing (depending on where and how you wish to live) can be very expensive. Do some research on school fees and look at ads for the type of housing you would find satisfactory. Your question can be answered; if you provide more details on your education/experience and what job you are being offered.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>School fees and housing are paid for by the company. I'm in corporate fin with over 10 years experience in North America.

			<RelCText>If you are making more in NA then stay put. Also their offer might increase by 2000 or so but won't be significantly different. As to the grade increase; this is not very likely as they cannot have someone doing the same job on a different grade. Creates a lot of problems for them</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Indefinite means only good. u r direct QP employee; not time based contractor which usually provided by 3rd party company/agency. most of the QP group employees are in indefinite contract. u will entitle for all benefits as per company's rules. housing allowances is given to all employee but supplement (3500) is given only to a married ones; I think. but in my company; housing allowance won't be given if your spouse also work there. coz it is already given to one of u.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"45;000 per month should easily afford you a very lavish lifestyle i would think. 10;000 a month for housing probably won't get you the pool that you desire; housing is insanely expensive in this country. If you must then i would put a bit of your own salary into securing the type of residence you really want; like novita77 said i would think 15000QR would get you a very nice place. you would still have plenty of cash left over to ""live it up"" esp if they are also giving you a car allowance like you stated in your post. QP is a well respected company that hires many foreigners. As every job i highly recommend you get everything in writing and signed by both parties."</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Dear friends; First of all; iÂ would like to thank you all for your amazing help and support. actually i got an offer from QP and it was good. they have requested to undergo a full medical examination and i did that and sent them the report through courier. i just wanna know; what&amp;#39;s the next step in the recruitment procedure and how long time it takes from then to issue meÂ work visa?

			<RelCText>NEXT STEP... I have explained this earlier and I will repeat it again..so that no one gets caught in an uncomfortable situation....Getting an offer and submitting a medical in QP is NOT a signal to move...Until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your Inbox..DO NOT RESIGN..I am sure in their Email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told... In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP...However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined..... QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times... The next step in your recruitment process is waiting and asking questions if you have any...Your VISA Could be ready in 1 month..or it can also be 4 months..so just wait..and DO NOT RESIGN from your current job....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I totally agree with tg; Sometimes things happen and this is not unusual here in Qatar. I know many people who resigned from their jobs hoping they will get the visa quickly and took up to 4 months. I work at HMC; they have their own immigration section and yet still they got me a visa in 6 weeks!!!!! so DO NOT ever ever ever resign your job and stay home until you really see your visa number with your two eyes ;) Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>hi all. I am planning on coming to doha with my 3 week old baby who has only got her BCG vaccination.

			<RelCText>I would get all the vaccinations done before you come. There are lots of good hospitals here; so it is not a problem.

			<RelCText>If you go to Hamad Hospital vaccines for kids under 1 are free. You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here; now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example; in the US they don't do BCGs; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer; but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I went to 3 places... Hamad; Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while; and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance; I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week; so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first; so bring the baby's RP; birth certificate; etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance; I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid; he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait. I used to go to Al Ahli but recently their waits have become hours long (with appointments!) and since they have a ""great"" kids play area; my kids were always coming home with some nasty sickness when w....."</RelCText>

I will pm you further details; since i have to leave now. Many serious incidents have occured there over the past weeks and as much as 5-6 babies have had to be rushed to Hamad Hospital because of gross medical negligence on the part of Al Ahli Hospital. I personally know of 1 baby who is still in the NCU of Hamad Hospital now; that had to be transferred from Al-Ahli. Stay far away from al-Ahli hospital and consider Hamad Hospital.

			<RelCText>Thanks you all for the responses; althought i must say that i've been quite worry about some comments. Are you people sure about those things (that a ahli don't have NICU)?? Did you actually gave birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this is like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody saying and reapeat as if was realy truth?? I'm asking because chosing a hospital/doctor far away from your home country is a very dificult decision; and al ahli hospital doesn't look like the kind of place you described. I like to hear from someone who actually delivered there. Is there anyone?? Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Her first three were at Hamad Medical and her last child was born in Al Ahli ONLY because she wanted her husband to attend the delivery. she compared all four deliveries and decided never to go back to Al Ahli. They are rude and broke her water - without her approval. She was emotionally and phsycologically abused by the nurses there. They wouldn't call her doctor when she was asked them to. We had to call her from our personal mobiles. Not a very pleasant experience. I'm having all my children at Hamad Medical.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hi; As of my knowledge; The National health center @ Abu hamour responsible for medical tests (once entered into the country;used to go for medical)only not for vaccination. For vaccination u need green card for the kid; for that u have go to Health commision back side of Hamad hospital ( from sports R/A to Fire station R/A; take right turn from Fire station R/A) approaching 200 mts one very big building. But yesterday she asked me r u from india; then she told it's in other place;i.e opp to Aldana hotel near sana R/A; one more medical commission is there. But they will give green card only and after that u have to go to u r regular health center; they will give the registrastion no and vaccination timings details. note: for issuing green card they need previous vaccination history record from u r county. if u have any doubts call to medical commision near aldana hotel @ 4312054 Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first you will have to take the vaccination card from your country go to ministry of health; they will give you a qatari vaccination card; so you will be able to track easily what your kid took and what's remaining; and then you will be directed to the health centre near your resident address; this is free but the other option is the private hospitals and this will cost you depending on the vaccine from 200-500 QR and also you will need this vaccination card; also its asked for at admission to schools they ask for it.</RelCText>

He had got bacteria through mouth. He has phelm in his chest and which got struck in his lungs. He cannot breathe..blah.blah;;;blah)"". But to my surprise; my son's chest was clear and he never had problem in breating. On all three occasions; he gave the same medication. Not only that; on my last visit; there was a Qatari with 2 kids before me and another family after me. We all (4 kids) met in the pharmacy and guess what; we all got exactly the same medication. I went there next day for my wife and saw my friend who just met Dr Khalid; he too got the same medication. I took my son to al-ahli; suspecting Dr Khalid and the doctor there was shocked to see that my son was diagnosed for brochitis while his chest is clear and breathing comfortably. I think he is fake."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally s.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>it kinda gets pretty cold. As DaRuDe said; 8 to 10 degrees. This may sound high; but when it rains or there is a wind; it feels much colder. I will second DaRuDe; last year; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one. Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold. Granted the cold snap does not last long; but who would want to give up their sleep. Days are pretty warm. Last year; I think; it was about a day or three that was very cold during the day and that was due to heavy rains.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Bring the normal clothes that you are wearing in Philippines. November is still a nice weather...not so hot nor cold. But on December to early February; it will be winter and you need some winter clothes; but not the thick ones. The jacket that we usually used on the cold rainy season will do as weather is not extremely cold in Qatar. It is still manageable. Don't bring too much clothes; you can buy from Qatar whenever you want to. There are clothe shops that are affordable and there is always on sale items.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for info Jauntie; the word moderate strikes a chill on my heart. I am so bored of the sun; I like it most of the year round but am going to feel cheated if you don't get any winter. (Also; am tired of watering the garden every night). Lala last year was lovely and cosy although I did feel bad for the Asian Games; it rained pretty much every day from 1st-15th December.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Seems like we're looking for the same thing around here. I'm pretty new here in Qatar and I've been in search for a lap pool nearby where I can continue my training...or at least keep myself fit. After reading several posts here; seems like those that are easily accessible (for a fee) are hotel pools. As for running; the only route I've tried so far is at the Corniche. I usually start near the Sheraton hotel and go the opposite end then back. Biking on the other hand...haven't tried yet as I didn't bring my bike here. My friends advised me not to since it's not a safe place to bike - due to the hot weather and also crazy drivers on the road. Although I'm still planning to buy a bike eventually and look for a long stretch of road outside the city where one can go cover several kms during the cold season.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>do you guys know where to find road bike shops here in doha? not to mention mechanics and parts... i have a regular beach swim site but i get to be active only when the weather cools down... soon it will come. sad to say my fitness level is at the lowest now. i think my swim place is safe enough for road bike laps during early weekend mornings... i really love to push ahead with brick works; let say swim/bike or swim/run... do you guys want to start from scratch as a tri-group??</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I am a hard core triathlete - and considering moving to Doha - I train about 20 hours per week - I've trained in Vegas during the summer; and while the heat isn't ideal; it is doable. I also train in New York City; and while the traffic and cars are not great - I've survived so far. What I need is a stretch of road that is at least wide; if not quiet. I need to ride between 80 and 120 miles on the weekends. A loop of 40 miles that I can do 3 times would work - but I need a decent shoulder or a place that isn't too busy - Is there such a thing as a ""country road"" near Doha? Is swimming in the ocean permitted? Can women swim too? Are there any lap pools? Maybe at the universities? When I train I usually wear the typical tri-outfit - is this going to be a problem? What about for women trainers?"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. QAWS (shutting down end of September; so please consider this your first stop as they have tons of animals to rehome); 2nd Chance Rescue; Cats in Qatar; and Qatar Veterinary Center. Look them all up on Facebook for news and pictures of their current adoptable cats. Some ask a small fee to cover money already spent on the cats spaying/neutering; microchip and vaccination costs; and some are completely free. 2. Depending on the kind of cat and where you go; it can be from 75QR to as much as 250QR for grooming. More reputable places such as the big vets (Parkview &amp; QVC) will charge more. 3. Anywhere from 100-500QR depending on what you need done.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Grooming isn't really necessary unless you get a persian or long haired cat. Save yourself the money and hassle and get a short haired Arabian Mau. They're hearty cats and you won't have a lot of health problems with them which will cut down on Vet costs. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Alyson; you can get Royal Canin for cats here; I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway; those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; the supermarkets have got a good supply of things recently. Oh and the 6QR shop at Hyatt Plaza often has nice toys. Another place you may want try is the shop at Pampered Pets boarding kennels they have some lovely beds; toys and treats.

			<RelCText>A better and more deserving place to get a pup is from the Animal care centre - it used to be called 'Paws and Claws' - not sure what it is called now. We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house. When we got him; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused. I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came; rounded them up and shot the parents; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre. We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup. He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter. There are good vetinary clincs in Doha; but still it is a bit expensive. Even then; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle; hug and love. If things go rough in school and her friends and teachers are mean; the dog is someone she would try to confide in; althought is cannot speak back.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Buying a dog/puppy for your daughter is a very big decision. You have to consider many things before you decide on something. We have got a Shiranian (ShihTzu+Pom) for our 3yr old son; believe it was a very good decision; both are very good pals now. Factors: How old is your daughter? If she is below 5 years; make sure she have a toy group; very quiet and playful puppy. If she is bigger may be you can get a bigger one. Because size and attitude of dog will matter Is your daughter asthmatic or ill constantly? Get low shedding or no shedding dogs. Is she ready for responsibilities? Can she clean; groom your pet. If not; you should be ready to do it for her; so that she doesnot feel distant from her pet. Flat? Staying in a flat; then you have to definitely get a quieter dog so that your neighbours dont complaint against you and regarding toilet training you dont have to worry; it will be tough initially but be persistent and you can work it out. Use a crate initially to keep your pet and .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Unfortunately the animals sold at Souq Wagif are in miserable condition so you will pay 3 times what you paid for the dog just to get it healthy. I was in search of a Siamese cat and bought a kitten there it took 3 weeks of hourly care and lots of Vet bills to keep the animal alive. Its a shame the govt. does not close it down its a menace to animal lovers. So don't buy the puppy and as stated its too young as well.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I wouldn't reccoemnt buying any animals from the souq. They are seriously mistreated (you only have to go and see them kept in the cages and sprayed with water to see that) and by buying one of these animals you are only further encouraging the sellers to mistreat animals. As others have said; there are better places to get animals (such as any of the vets who always have animals for adoption either in the centre or advertised on the boards). Finally; please consider if you and your daughter are ready for a dog. I personally; wouldn't have a dog in a my small 2 bed flat. I do; however; have a cat. Dogs must be walked every day (even in the heat of summer);. What will you do if you go on annual leave? Dogs are more expensive to be looked after than cats because they need more attention. Are you ready to pay high vet bills if your pet gets sick and can you afford the right amount of food every day? If you are confident that you are ready for a dog; then I wish you and your daughter the b.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY DOGS OR CATS FROM ANY SOUQS OR PET SHOPS! A 4 week old puppy should still be with it's mother. The chances are that if you take it home; you will get attached to it and then it will die. It's too young to be away from it's mum; it's too young to be vaccinated; it won't have had proper puppy formula or health treatments. Please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dogs and puppies in the souqs. They are normally sick; not vaccinated or too young. Some have diseases that can be passed to humans and you never know if the dog maybe belongs to somebody already and it has been stolen/found and sold to the pet shops. If you seriously want a dog and are ready for the committment for the next 15 years; please contact one of the animal rescue groups or adopt a pet from a family. And make sure that whatever animal you get - it must have been vaccinated and neutered.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You would not be allowed to take a dog to the mall; but there are plenty of places you can take them for a walk if you don't mind driving a little bit. You would also have to check with your landlord that you're allowed to keep a dog in your villa/apartment. Obviously a garden is ideal for a dog; but it is possible to keep one in an apartment block; as long as you're willing to take it out for walks everyday. I suggest you talk to these people; www.qaws.org</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here; what nationality are you? If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well the salary seem to be good; but if you are bring your family then house of 2BK without furnish and good lcoation would not cost you less then 4000 qr. then furnuiture and basic requirement that shall shoot upto 10K. So indirect 5k per month would be the rent. then car if you go for high end car apprx starting from 100000 to 123000 then monthy EMI would be between 4000 to 4500. then food and other expensies..Now it is totallly depend on how you spend it dude.

			<RelCText>We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally s.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Motor Insurance in Doha</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly. I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Insurance is between 3% and 4% a year...and seriously; while the driving keeps you on your toes...it isn't THAT bad!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Life only can be understood backwards; but must be live forward. Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean. We pay around 2000 QR for our cars. Again our car are not a posh car. :-)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I looked at where you come from and really don't know what you did or what your salary was in Greece as u say u come from. 14000 converted to Euros = 2912;79 on todays rate; which is nothing 8000 for housing is average and you will get a average place and if you have to furnish out of your own pocket well; 2nd hand is the way to go. 1500 car allowance it is do-able but vehicle prices are also on the rise so hire a car and stick to that; hassle free.

I did mine without asking the police clearance ... the guy in Johnson said in certain percentage of blackout you dont need a police clearance.

			<RelQBody>While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.</RelCText>

Do some parents not care for the safety of their children or what????? There are so many accidents here and a child would fly through the front window should a car have an accident and most probably result in death. Please peeps keep your children seatbelted in the BACK of the car otherwise you could find yourself laying them to rest before you pass away.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"in this region subscribe to. But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar (""Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows.""); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books. I feel sorry for the kids who have these people as parents. But I guess it's just Social Darwinism in action.

			<RelCText>We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally s.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sueño P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions). We'll have playgroups; Mums Night Out; and Expectant Moms Group; etc. There are no dues or anything like that. . .just fun :o)"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"This is one of my pet peaves...back home (Houston; Texas) children;according to their age; must be in a car seat. Knowing that this law does not exist here and how upset I would get; my husband warned me before hand; ""Now; you're gonna see a lot of children that should be in car seats and they're not."" NOT having children in carseats; in the event of an accident; can lead to paralysis or even death. Everyone should wear their safety belts. SAD STORY: (I was a high school teacher) One of my students; Eric; had just earned a full football scholarship to the University of Texas. One night; he was in the backseat of a mid-size car and had fallen asleep and was not wearing his seat belt. The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital. The others had been wearing their seatbelts and were not injured. Eric was paralyzed. Consequently; he was not able to play ball for UT. The UT law....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Amen. Nothing is more important and I believe that you and the others that utilize their car seats for their little ones (and big ones for that matter) are setting a great example...maybe it will actually ""catch on"" here! ;) Sad Memory: I remember getting to the hospital that night after another teacher called with the news. The rest of the family was there as well...how tragic...in time; the news spread of how a fellow classmate; a close friend to many; was not going to be able to walk and play ball. Others vowed to ""buckle up"" as we say in south Texas. They had learned a hard lesson. If this story helps even one person remember to take the time to use seatbelts/car seats...it was worth sharing. The Good News: He went on to complete his degree from UT. I last heard he was in law school with hopes of becoming a lawyer specializing in defending rights for the disabled."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Why are people so careless with the lives of their children? I can´t undestand it. My mother-in-law walked the streets in our smal town; with a stroller; for four hours while she waited for me to get out of work; just because she didn´t know if she had put the seat in the right way; she didn´t take the chance. Never gamble with your childs life; I could never live with myself if something happened to any of my children because I didn´t use a car seat.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"was perhaps 2 days ago. At the Traffic lights at Hyatt Plaza a vehicle over took me and pulled in front of me at the red lights. As i looked into the car in front i could see a child of no more than two years old asleep on the back shelf; facing the window. Even my daughter who is four said"" look at that silly baby"" Ive not seen a collsion yet where the backend of the vehicle and rear window hasnt been smashed. Some people dont deserve to have children. I thought about taking a picture with my phone and contacting the Police; but i think we know the possible outcome there!

			<RelCText>I'll try to answer your questions to the best of my abilities. My son is about to turn 8 months old so I had a lot of similar questions when I came out here three months ago. Toys 'r' Us has a small selection of baby items. That said; I was surprised to see some of the items that I found there (i.e. Bumbo seat) but they were more expensive than what I could pay back home. Brand varies depending on what kind of product you're looking for. Here's what I found: Baby items (nursing/feeding): Chicco; Avent; Munchkin; Gerber; etc. car seats/Strollers: MacLaren; Pliko; Chicco; Graco Jarred food: Gerber; limited selection of Heinz organic; hero Formula: Similac; Nan (by Nestle) Diapers: Pampers and Huggies and Luv?? (recommend Pampers) As far as toys are concerned; you can find them just about anywhere! Plenty to choose from and a lot of award wining toys. Clothes: For newborns; I'd recommend Baby Shop and Mothercare. Good selection and good quality Probably the most disappointing thing was th.....</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Today children returned late from School (DPS -MIS);the reason being a child was found dead in the school bus. From what I heard; the child dozed off in the bus during her morning trip. The driver did not notice and the child was left in the bus. They found her in the afternoon ;it should have been the heat in the bus that killed her. She was just 4 years old. Did anyone hear about this ?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>This news seems true and school has expressed condolences and a holiday tomorrow. Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....</RelCText>

Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.</RelCText>

I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for.

			<RelCText>I go there almost every weekend; cause I plan to do some Kite There are broken glasses; bottles; tires; carpets; plastic bags everywhere; month of May is long gone. I think renting a heavy machine to grade; and remove all the trash; was a morning job; and everybody will profit it. Is unbelievable; the amount of broken plastic chairs; and stuff you can find there. I think the beach deserve our respect and protection; I'm not criticizing; but the damage is done; and action and not words need to be taken; every time I go there I bring my trash; and some times pick some plastic bottles around. Now there is a big dump of sand; maybe for construction. In a Country almost like an Island; not having a proper beach to go; is a shame. I can use Hotels; but to be honest for example the beach of the Resort in Messaid is worst; not only the trash but boats and jet skis like fly's. Check mate.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>that everyone feels it is the job of expats to clean up this country and the role of the locals to trash it in the first place. I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking. I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution. Please don't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones. When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country (and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them); I'll gladly stop and lend a hand. -- Since Allah has given me a brain; it would seem like a sin not to use it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>beach to clean ... the constructions going there took care of everything and cleaned the beach of everything even the sand. These guys never have a dull moment; doing constructions everywhere and damaging more than constructing. Wait for another 2 years and there would be no need to clean the beach; the cleaning staff would do the rest and you had to pay to visit the beach :( Do not dwell in the past; do not dream of the future; concentrate the mind on the present moment.

			<RelCText>I think so. If you only want to see sea beach then Dukhan is ok. There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan. Beware of Channa Fish! They are very dangerous; especially during the onset of winter. They generally don't attack humans; but if they are hungry they may eat humans! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and doesn't want to hunt; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey(the human bathers). If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic! Have a nice swim at Dukhan! Cya.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello there; as i do live in dukhan for quite long time; i don't recommend you camping at um bab beach. nothing serious about it but normally people don't camp there!plus safety wise your gonna be far away from dukhan if you need assistance.not good location too i guess around there to camp; but just wanted to let you know since you've asked; you could try further down dukhans beach after the beach house (after the QP sailing club)if you know what i mean good clean spots you could always find. anyways good luck mate have fun!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; that's where I'm talking about VW. I don't take our dog off the leash; so it's not a problem for me that the roadway is busy. He really likes that stretch of grass; since the only real greenery he usually sees are desert shrubs :) I sometimes have to keep him on a shorter leash if anyone is out jogging or walking; but it doesn't seem like the area is frequented very much by others most of the times that I've been out there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well i usually walk my dog near the Gulf Cinema 'n walk like 2 km from there; i don't usually find people walking there so it's good for my dog coz shez scared of people specially kidz.... i used to go to corniche almost everyday to walk my dog; if u go at like 3 am on normal dayz you wouldn't find alot of people walking; but if u go there on a friday night you'll find it hard as all the kidz and people will be walking next to you or behind you... last thursday it was really quite there; usually there are lots of people on thursdays and fridayz...... but other non holiday dayz you wouldn't find alot of people...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>On our foreign ministry's site I read that it is absolutely forbidden to bring Rottweilers; Dobermann and Boxer dogs. Would be a pity so I'd have to leave my believed Rottweiler Kelly with my parents. Does anybody have a clue why this is so? Because they are considered dangerous? I mean a Pit bull would be more dangerous then those three races. (Yes I know; any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hands; even a Yorkshire; though there would be little reason to fear him.). Where would you buy dogs in Qatar? I mean; if I'd have to leave Kelly at home; I'd love to have some dog around to keep me company if there is no woman who'd volunteer for the job... *gg* Rene -------------------- think different.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>also Zekreet area is nice to camp out; if you drive from sealine resort to inland sea by the coastline (thru the dunes and not the dessert highway) there are a few nice camp spots as well witch are clean and not crowded later on the day. we tent to leave at midday from sealine resort do a bit offroading / dune bashing and then camp out with and have a dive in sea; some stay overnight as well (me included) you do need a real 4x4 tough to do so; for zekreet area a crossover will work fine</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Be warned!!!! the worst car dealership i have had the misfortune to go to is the Nissan dealer. Granted; nissan have a great line-up of cars but the poor service of the dealer has made it no joy to own a Nissan. my view; considering best value and quality and after sales service. best 4x4 - toyota (LC or Prado) best luxury saloon - mercedes e class best economy family saloon - maza 6; toyota camry best economy compact - maza 3; toyota yaris worst--- hummer...ssangyong (eg rexton)... anything european (except merc.

			<RelCText>I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible.. THEY DONT SERVICE THE CAR AT ALL..JUST DO OIL AND FILTER CHANGE ALL THE TIME... ASK THEM FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL TALK OF A SCHEDULE OF LEAVING THE CAR THERE FOR FEW DAYS (USUALLY 3 DAYS)... IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM?? NISSAN CARS ARE REALLY GOOD..but the dealership at QATAR is a living SHAME...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>No Mr. Lincoln! its not a wiper fluid refill. Mechanically i am looking only at changing the timing belt and the axel boots in the front. I am keen to do cosmetic work on the cruiser. Complete body re-paint and polish...but i am looking for someone who does a really really neat job. Most of the paint shops out there just want to get the job done and are not overly concerned about the quality. As a customer; my top concern is the quality and finishing. Any suggestions guys? Any phone numbers would be appreciated. cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"my few experience : 1) I had noise on my Honda steering; plus steering was hard; i visited one mechanic in industrial area; he asked for QAR 400 for fixing... then i went to another mechanic; he asked for QAR 1500 ! said; i need to replace the entire unit including some belts (?)... then i went to third mechanic; and he found it was nothing... just power steering oil was to fill. and he fixed it in just 2 minutes and i was very happy to pay him QAR 50. my cost was dropped from 1500 to 50 Riyals ! 2) another incident; the vehicle was giving noise while putting in reverse gear. I went to the same mechanic who earlier had fixed steering problem just in 2 minute; and he asked for some checkup in German Computer. I did the checkup and computer gave an error code with description ""reverse solenoid blaa blaa blaa"". I presented the report to him; he said; the gearbox has to open and replace some switch inside and asked for the spare part from Honda + 500 Riyals for labour charge and 2 days tim....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i saw a full review of it (its also called a dacia duster in europe) on a popular motoring program and they were very impressed with its robustness and reliability..it has serious off road capability and is practical around town too. The car itself is good but I'm not sure if it would have good resale value here. But if resale isn't an issue; and you like the car; then go for it by all means. you can search for 'dacia duster fifth gear' on youtube if you'd like to see the review yourself. best of luck:-)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well i don't have any idea about renault costs; but what i can tell you with full belief and accuracy is that NOTHING comes close to the reliability and low maintenance costs of japanese cars; especially toyota. they just keep going on and on and on. and if you stick to the basic recommended maintenance schedule; toyotas could run forever haha..i saw a toyota camry few days back which had been driven 798000 kms..that is absolutely and unbelievably high mileage..and the car was ten years old..i could not believe how smooth and quiet it was..all the owner did was take good care of the engine and change oil regularly because he drove a lot..if maintenance and cost and reliability is a concern for you; then japanese cars are the way to go. best of luck:-)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Peace be upon you; and how do you do?. First of all; when you live in any Arabian Gulf countries; and thinking to buy a car; then it is better to buy a Japanese car as first choice. However; if you are still new in here and just started working and wants to invest your money in a car; then buy a small Japanese Sedan/Saloon car; as it could save you a lot of money more than any other european cars; specailly here in the Arabian Gulf; as there is not much of experienced good workshops to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future. SO either you go to Mitsubishi cars or Toyota; but Nissan is the last choice as I heared that their workshop is very busy and costing more money; so do Renault which could cost you much more than Nissan. Nevertheless; no one is going to push you away from the car that you would love to buy; but as an advice from a person who has been living in Qatar for 35 years and had and experince with many types of cars; then it is better for you to think more .....</RelCText>

I admit that high level service culture is not up to anticipated standards in many business areas in Qatar; I can easily jot down a list of valid reasons for that; howeve we at Al Attiya are very active in addressing all issues pertainin to customer service at all our outlets and it would be great if I can meet with you personally to dwell further on your experience and take it as a learning lesson; so please do not hesitate to drop by to see me in my office anytime convenient to you.

Mr. Najam 55215605 Bengali. It is a coil that he would replace for Qar. 200/300. Optionn # 2; Go to Japan Autos in street 26; buy a used AC compressor for Qar. 500 with the coil and get is replaced.

			<RelCText>Make sure you don't use to small or too large a pot for your house plants; I have kept plants in their same container for 10 years and they are fine depends on the plant.  Also you mentioned manure; you don't use manure on indoor plants; I hope you meant soil. I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a  while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.  Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.  I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now. There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well..LP...understood but there are maybe's here in particular that desalination of seawater and brines within particular WHO regions and globally is a large and rapidly growing process for producing new drinking-water. There is a clear public health and environmental protection argument for providing guidance on production of desalinated water for drinking-water. There are certain chemicals and microbes that are of particular importance in desalinated water. Of these; particular concern has been expressed regarding the presence of microbes due to blending of final waters that; because they were derived from coastal and marine sources; may not be adequately addressed. Similar concerns have been noted about particular chemicals in source water or that are not well removed by the desalination process.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; am using a RO Water purification system close to a year and it works perfect and we feel of having a 100% purified drinking water. Need to change filter every six months. Water from tap is good to drink but due to pipeline and untidy water tanks in your apartment you might need to buy &amp; install a Panasonic water purifier which i think is more enough to purify/fitler your tap water and start use that for drinking purposes. I have the two in my house; where I came in without knowing about Panasonic being installed as part of furnished stuff. It's better you avoid drinking botttled water; they are meant for immediate needs. Good Luck! I have an article about this; let me know your e-mail ID; so to e-mail you that stuff.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I understand; the bottled water which is meant for drinking is essentially desalinated through distillation and then processed with some mineral salts. Non-drinking water could be a mix of RO; distilled and recycled waste water. In this there could be chances of chemicals ( in very low concentations) which are meant to act as lubricants and anti-corrosion agents during reverse osmosis since these additives are not removed fully by the semi-permeable membrane. I don't know if consumption of these chemicals could be detrimental to health in the long run. Expert opinion is required.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I thought it was a bit boring.     Beautiful decorations (heard they cost 60;000QR) ; tables; lots of sweets.   However it got started very very late  (left at11:00pm; dinner had not started)   Out of 300 women in the room I only saw I dress that I liked.   Most were garish and hideously gaudy.   Lots of Bright bright colors; feathers; sequins; etc.    TONS of makeup on.    They had a runway and a couple of women played the drums and wailed Arabic songs rather loudly.   Girls would get up and dance down the runway (so the older women could check them out as possible daugher-in-law contenders I've been told) Finally the lights went down about 10:00 the fog and light show started--sort of like a rock concert!   The bride then came out and walked very slowly down the runway.    Eventually people came up and showered her head with money.  She looked scared to death.  I learned she was 20 years old and had never met her husband-to-be; but had talked to him on the.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>from my experience; no matter how flamboyantly u dress up; its NOTHING compared to the Qatari ladies there. god; they r all so gorgeous; and their way of dressing up is amazing. cant afford (lol) ;)) abt the gift; no u dont take a gift to the wedding. usually i visit them few days after the wedding; n give a gift. wat happens during a weddin? well; make sure u sit away from the loudspeakers placed at all corners of the hall :-)) u can dance if u want; to the arabic songs being played there. hhhmmm;; n the food part; its yummy. u can starve for a few days after that to lose all those calories earned on that one evenin:-) its fun; ENJOY!! PS: oh yeah; like many others mentioned above; dont click any snaps. n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside. usually they hold it at the entrance. so be prepared to be disconnected from the rest of the world for the few hours u spent there..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Unfortunately; I have found Qatari weddings to be a bit depressing... I have yet to see it as a joyous occassion... I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason.... The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing...

			<RelCText>Most of the play areas (Jungle Zone; Extreme world; Rays Reef) will do parties and I think you can specify food arrangements although most use the FF outlets. Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ahh; I see. I've worked in oil camps before so I know what you mean about adjusting to the life. In other words; there is no way to take a bus or taxi to any small town that is nearby - like Al Khor - just to get away from the work site for a few hours? Sometimes it's good to get into a different scene for a while. Is there taxi service outside Las Raffan?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you have a car you can drive out of Ras Laffan. Some companies provide cars for employees to do this. Also; the camp accomodation I've seen has internet and cable TV in all the rooms; and there's a good gym and a swimming pool and a bar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Airlines...I have traveled by Qatar Airways; Gulf Airways; Air India. Of which I would Rate Air India above QA &amp; GA. In fact the most comfortable was Jet Airways (previously it was National carrier now its gone International and has flights from Doha-India-Doha). I would have to say Jet was the best with Leather Seats; nice leg space; good service et all...(Jet's service is legendary in India) In QA &amp; GA both; my knees were continously touching the front seat &amp; was very uncomfortable. It felt almost as if I was travelling in a Bus...lol Sevice wise I guess all were as good (QA with Filipino staff were good too); But the comfort of the Seat and the Leg space would be the most prized by me.</RelCText>

I presume you can get most things there. 2. Are there; and can you recommend a health facility that would be suitable for my son to continue his speech therapy and ASD assessments?

			<RelCText>"Hi Cat; I just wanted to congratulate you on your pregnancy. You will find that there is lots of baby gear shops in Doha including Mothercare; The Baby Shop; Toy's R us; Chicco and others. So yes; you will find here everything you need for your little one. I'm not sure what you mean by ""children facilities""; if you refer to medical care; I think is really good. Please do a search about child-birth in this website and you will find lots of info. I'm not familiar with special needs health facilities here in Doha so cannot give you a personal opinion; but the Marhaba magazine talks about to centres; so it might be a good starting point for you to enquiry about speech teraphy and assessment: Shafallah Centre: The opening of the centre's new state of the art facility in West Bay in 206 offers worldclass facilities and education for special needs children in Qatar. It includes a 150 bed hospital and stadium. The Learning Center: This institution is part of Qatar Foundaztion and offers a numb....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Welcome to Doha and congratulations for ur pregnancy. I would like to take this opportunity and talk about bare facts regarding Autism care in Doha. My son is 7 years old and is undergoing OT in India. He is diagonsed with HFATS - high functioning autistic traights spectrum. he is joining me by last week October'07. There are just 4 neurologists in this country. I will write their names tomorrow as I do not have them handy rigth now. there is one Neurosurgeon in Doha clinic - he is more of a doctor for orthopaedic patients. Second is a lady neuro paedratic. She is in UK for her knee transplant an should be back in Doha in first week Nov'07. I did meet both of them and their feed back is neuro care is absolutely zero in Doha. There are two more neurologists in Hamad hospital. Havent met them yet. Shafallah center is for complete mentally challenged kids. I met the officials there and they would not do any OT training to outside kids. The kid has to study there and that is where our kids.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The choices for support of special needs are limited here; folks. I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know! My preschooler goes to see a Canadian lady who works with him on his speech delay/pronunciation problems once a week. She is licensed; qualified and very good. I pay out of pocket over $80/week for one hour of services for him. I would NOT recommend either Shafallah or The Learning Center. The former is for severely mentally disabled children (mostly locals) and the latter is a school but; again; populated mostly with locals and it's a watered-down curriculum with few genuinely-trained specialists on staff to deal with the types of things you're thinking of *they're mostly regular teachers who have had a few inservices on working with kids with ADD -- that's about it). I recently found an Occupational Therapist here; but it was HARD.

			<RelCText>Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....</RelCText>

I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for.

			<RelCText>yes I've just checked that website and it's obviously not working...I got it from the Marhaba summer 07 edition; where you can find an article about homeschoolers in Qatar; in the education section. I thought if was a good starting point; since there seemst to be an organised group with membership for parents who teach curriucula full-time at home. On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

			<RelCText>We will be moving to Doha in the early spring. I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I don't know if this is a very popular option. There is a tutoring place here called Cedars and I think some people use this while they are waiting for school places. Tel 468 8192 email cedarstutoring@hotmail.com Getting school places is a problem in Doha but if you have a British passport; you have a better chance than some because you will be given priority in the British curriculum schools. I'm sure you've probably researched which ones are popular here - any that come under the umbrella of BSME (British Schools of the Middle East) and are not-for-profit are generally sound - They have a website www.bsme.org.uk Obviously the best option would be to come over to Doha on a 'look see' visit so that you can check out the schools yourself. In any event; if you are looking for places to start September 2007; you need to act now as it may take 3 - 6 months to go through the process of applying/entrance tests for secondary children etc If have children at secondary and primary level I would.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse. There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject. Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum. Finally; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government. This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school. You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College; DESS; Sherborne and the International School of London. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Joe90 Not sure how qualified you are to comment on the status of the teachers at Park House school. ALL their teacher comply with SEC conditions on qualifications of their teachers; otherwise they would not be able to operate! I can confirm the vast majority of teachers at the school are British; 2nd is South African (excellent standard of educated teachers) and other nationalities. The school is as british as it gets in a non-british country. The standards are extremely high. There is very positive school/parent contact and all pupils are expected to work hard; are well disciplined; and result focused. I am british and my children attend Park House. I would have no problem with them returning to the UK (not likely with the current working conditions in the UK!) and slipping into very good schools and coping with the change. If you are typical middle class parents who discipline your children and make sure they stay on top of their studies you will reap the benefit of this school which.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As a user of the Qatari and British education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher; your child and you are lucky!

			<RelCText>Craftyqueen; let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes; given to a volunteer parent (who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions) who is supposed to help them develop reading skills. Not only is that wrong; but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class. And don't try and tell me it's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1. Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House. The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking! Waiting hours for nothing? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Alumnar I am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on QL. Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place. In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read. I can't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading. If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion. In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week; their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible. The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week. Parents are asked to participate in their child's learning by listening to their child read at home. Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere. As for fairness - the World is not fair and.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading. For example; are we comparing Parkhouse (or any other school in Doha) with fee-paying; independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school; I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison. One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are ""extremely high"". Well; if there is an acute shortage of school places; then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates. I have not heard much about Parkhouse's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their ""extremely high standards"". That also might explain Parkhouse's preference for nice; white English children. Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC; the Supreme Council of Education. This is a ....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello guys;Im a filipino physiotherapist. parents should not be ashamed of having a child with special needs.If they dont do something about the condition of their child;they deprived the rights their child to have an education. In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam;its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future. This is a touching and heart pounding story how a mental challenged father strive to have her little girl. Hope you like this film.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>QIS is a good school and has excellent results. The pastoral side is too very good; with caring staff. Qatar Academy maybe the school where money is no object but the academic standards are not as impressive; especially in Primary. Doha College is a good school but fees are high; Primary section ws a school that merged with the existing Doha College - secondary school. DESS is also a British school here - mainly British kids. Noticed you are from the Netherlands; there is a Shell School in Doha that has the Dutch curriculum incorporated into it. Hope that this all helps; warning there is a huge demand for schools in Doha as the expat population is increasing more quickly than new schools can be set up - so get your children down an a waiting list ASAP.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We relocated our teenagers in August and finally settled for QIS and are very pleased because the school has been extremely helpful and supportive in accepting two non-native speaking kids into year 10 and 12. We can recommend the school to 100%. Our kids came from the liberal Swedish school system but have settled very well. We have visited ALL English-speaking schools in Doha; and the only problem is that they are all full. Waitlisting and constant telephone calls to find out if something is happening is my advice. We spent 6 months before coming to Qatar to find a school; including 2 trips to sit entrance tests. Nerve-wracking - a week before school start we knew they had a place....</RelCText>

Where do you even start to look? We have three boys under 4 (a liitle crazy..I know)so I guess living in a compound might be the sane answer; but from what info I have it seems impossible to rent anywhere.

			<RelCText>My information is that the American School of Doha has a majority faculty of qualified and experienced teachers from North America.  The same cannot be said of the other school I mentioned where I know that they have staff there who have no teaching qualification whatsoever and who may not have English as their native language. Most parents looking for an American education for their children would prefer the faculty to at least have English as their native tongue; not to mention the requisite qualifications and experience Ummhamza; calm down; I'm just putting the information that I have out there for the benefit of the original poster.

			<RelCText>Salam PM.  Yes; I do find it quite disturbing that there are many schools in Qatar with staff with no teaching qualification.  Most schools are profit making so inevitably (sometimes big) corners are cut and it's always the child who loses by being given a sub-standard education.  I'm also very disappointed that the local Independent Schools have teachers teaching English who cannot even speak English properly.  We are letting ourselves down unecessarily.

			<RelQSubject>Life in Doha with toddler</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Good evening to everybody; we are moving to Doha in April and I am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months. I was wondering if you can tell me how is life with a toddler in such a hot country? Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat. What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Hi; I have 3 children and they love the outdoors but during the summer months I send them out only after sunset because it's really hot and we have a lot of sand storms or dust storms so then it's either malls or playing indoors at friends homes. There are a few mother and toddler groups that do fun activities so you could join them. July and August are school holidays here so many go on vacations. Ramadan is also around this time so no eating or drinking outside and shops open late too. Best of luck with your move.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>most westerners escape summer heat especially july-august. I know several families where the wife leaves for Europe as of mid-june until end of Aug. You have to be creative to keep them busy since Doha offers very little to keep kids busy (unless you want spend 3-4 hours in a mall each day).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Us ""mums""; A.K.A. stay-at-home-dads; get together with other mums and dads; and have outings to the zoo; park; beach; water front; park; park and park. It's only hot for a few months; so plenty of chances to get out and about with out the kids melting. Plenty of classes such as music classes; gymnastics (for toddlers); playgroups and other things. We have found Doha very much geared toward families with children. Whilst we hear our single friends complain about Doha being too boring; people like us can only dream of the days when we could sleep in for two days if we felt like it. Don't worry; Doha is a very family-friendly place with many activities inside and out; for children. Cheers"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Papu21; Doha is quite a safe city. When we shifted from UK to Doha; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers &amp; smoke alarms in our rented villa; if you are worried about fires. Re health; we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler. You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open; on your own or with your child; in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt. No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side. This is quite common for locals and expats here. Re driving; I find that there is hardly any road courtesy; lots of big car.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Guys this is a chaos by some one mischevious. We Indians have been able to contribute only because we have got slapped in home &amp; school. We are here in GCC as the greatest demand work force in all areas in terms of skills; tolerance; business; management and above all compatability; because we have been slapped. This has given us the name of biggest and trustable employees among all the nationalities &amp; are at par of all as per the GCC nationals say so. I'm proud we are Indians. Don't get dragged away by stupid man made rules when the creator has asked us to teach behaviour whatever way it applies. Kids are very soft and I like them more than you people who look really less matured to pass such comments. We create ourselves above the mighty knowledge of the creators who has many trillions years experience and we not even mature in the age of 40 - 50 years that we survive as adults. Pass comments only when you fell like being knowing more on the subject.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Child dies in School bus in DPS</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Today children returned late from School (DPS -MIS);the reason being a child was found dead in the school bus. From what I heard; the child dozed off in the bus during her morning trip. The driver did not notice and the child was left in the bus. They found her in the afternoon ;it should have been the heat in the bus that killed her. She was just 4 years old. Did anyone hear about this ?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>This news seems true and school has expressed condolences and a holiday tomorrow. Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Actually the payment is 3 weeks for every year worked; not a month. The Labour Law changed in 2004; previously there was a sliding scale whereby you got more payment for every year that you worked (and the payment was based on full salary not just basic). If you get your hands on the old law you could arugue to your employer that the previous law applied up until January 2005 when the current law was enacted. Worth a shot. Tresgandas your calculation would come out to be the total salary paid; not the EOSB amount.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period; the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Gratuity is paid @ 21 days per year which is calculated on your last basic salary. In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01; 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so; the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22;093.15 Apart from this; your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that; 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. Last basic salary (multiplied) by 12 months (year) and (divided) by 365 (days in year). = X 2. Years of Service (multiplied) by Agreed Gratuity (days in a year)= Y 3.

			<RelCText>Cheques will be encashed immediately on presentation at a bank irrespective of its issuing date; according to the relevant provisions of Qatar’s Commercial Law; which takes effect on May 13; 2010. According to Article 580 of the Commercial Law of Qatar (Law No.27 of 2006); the cheque shall be ‘payable at sight’. In the event the cheque was presented before the date set as its issuing date; the instrument shall be paid on its presentation date. If a cheque bounces for lack of funds when presented at a bank; the drawer will be liable for its value and he/she may be prosecuted; convicted of a penal offence; fined or imprisoned; sources said yesterday. The provisions of the law take effect in May next year following the expiry of the three-year period notified after its implementation. The law was issued on July 27; 2006 and implemented six months after gazette publication. Effectively; the system of issuing ‘post-dated’ cheques will get scrapped with the law taking effect; a sen.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>economic issues (taxes and benefits); but don't know for sure. I think if everyone agrees and they can support themselves; they shouldn't be penalized. But I do think that children are made the unwitting partners in these situations and it can be very; very hard on them. They don't actually get to consent and the choice is made for them. I don't think the West is scared at all about polygamy. They simply don't approve of it in their societies. It's their right; isn't it? Please note: Prostitution is not legalized in the US (except in one strange county in Nevada that I have never understood) nor is same sex marriage; except in a very few cases.

			<RelCText>it's not only in the west but also on some countries in the east that polygamy/ bigamy is outlawed. the reason is simple; it is illegal in the new testament (bible). i'm not sure what's the reason for buddhist countries like thailand &amp; singapore to adopt monogamy though. for muslim countries like malaysia and indonesia; it is common for muslims there to marry only one. cultural convention; maybe.. in my country; adultery/ concubinage is a serious crime. but it is a crime that is so hard to find evidence of:-) usapa na...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Polygamy is not a crime; you just can not be married to multiple individuals which has become a standard that derived from Judaism/Christian values. As time progressed and the consequences form multiple partners slowly revealed itself; std's HIV and such; we can conclude that this has been the right approach. Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples' clubs; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular. Prostitution in some countries is legal; some not. As goes for me governments should legalize prostitution and register all that practice; create labor unions and tax them over their income. Why? This cuts the throat of crime; represses human trafficking and serves a purpose in society. The same goes for soft-drugs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"""The Star and Crescent signifies concentration; openness and victory; as well as sovereignty and divinity. According to tradition; in 339 BC a brilliant waxing moon save Byzantium (now Istanbul) from attack by Philip of Macedon. To mark their gratitude; the citizens adopted the Crescent of Diana as the city's emblem. When the city became the Christian Constantinople in 330 AD; its Crescent assumed the significance of an attribute of the Virgin Mary. In 1299; conquering what is now Turkey; Sultan Osman had a vision of a crescent moon stretching over the world; it thus became a symbol of the Ottoman dynasty; and when Constantinople fell to Muhammad II in 1453; the crescent came to represent both Islam and the Turkish empire. The star was added by Sultan Selim III in 1793 (its five points being established in 1844)."" Source : ""Signs &amp; Symbols; page 42; by Clare Gibson"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Updated May 2010: 1. All the bike shops around Bombay Silk Centre (referred to above) don't exist anymore since much of the area (between Mannai roundabout to Souk Wakif) has been demolished and fenced for the upcoming DohaLand; so don't bother. 2. The shop ""Skate Shack"" on Salwa Road (on your left after the 2nd roundabout when coming from Ramada) is good but has high end bicycles - cheapest one is QR 1700 3. The 2 shops on the corner of TV Roundabout are low end shops - I bought a bicycle from there for QAR 450... obviously nothing fancy but it works for a routine entry-level recreational street/park biker like me 4. Lulu and Carrefour have very little variety don't go 5. Go Sport and Sports Mart again have higher end sports bikes."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Comimg from Villagiio down to Al Saad; take the left turn on MOBIL Petrol Station Signal (it will be on ur right hand; there is also SIXT Rental Car); take left from that signal...then you drive straight I guess around 3 roundabouts...I dont remember exactly unfortunately. Then you take a right turn till the end of the road and make again right...you will be on the new road; but take the side road and drive straight. The Embassy will be on your right hand. Please make sure with the map; I just gave you approx.direction. I was there on October; cant remember the exact turns. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Al Million Taxi Service</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Had anyone taken rides with Karwa's new franchised taxis operated by Al Milllion? I have yet to take a rdie in one of these new franchised taxis. So I don't know about their services. Are the drivers better behaved than those from Karwa or Mowasalat? Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service. Any comment?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I've tried Al Million Taxi so far it was a good experience. The taxi was on time; there was a text from them prior to the agreed time and the name of the driver with the plates. The meter was on and the destination was plotted in their metering machine. But yes since the driver was new he was'nt familiar with where I was going so I have to tell the directions. Other than that I have no problem with getting a taxi from them!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I wanted to talk about this topic anyway. Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away(Near Falcon Petrol Station). He did'nt know where mall round about is. He did'nt know how to change lanes. The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window. Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living. Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities... The taxi was new and clean. The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals. I welcome Million Taxi; with all its faults. Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>we had tried this new taxi recently. as mentioned above; they are polite than the old karwa drivers. They show their respect to costumers not like the old karwa taxi drivers which are arrogant and this new million taxi; they are not choosing their costumers! They charged us an extra 4riyals because they had two meters running. one is always 4 riyals and the other one start at 4 riyals. This is way better than the ole Karwa Taxi's! i hope they'll maintain their good image though.</RelCText>

The Mega Mart has almost eberything including the paste for tom soup;but they are closing on the 13th tomorrow. They will probably send all there stuff to the other one. Alot of fresh stuff can be found in large supermarkets. We love the yellow curry which I replace with shrimp.That receipe book has been a big help.Go to Thai Choice website for more receipes.

			<RelCText>Hi there; Loki is right.. no major book stores here except for a saudi-owned franchise called Jarir. You might find a few of the latest paperbooks but its a rather dismal selection if you are a book lover and are used to stacked shelves that you see at Chapters; Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble. Best bet is Amazon and picking up books from Dubai. Btw - I am a member of a book club and there are several more.

			<RelCText>I was not allowed to sponsor my husband on family visa either. Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"LP ?? ""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; If your spouse is under your sponsorship: meaning the visa indicated on his/her Qatar ID or Resident Permit is Family Visa; then there is no need for them to be sponsored by an employer unless you feel that there will be more benefits that you can get if your spouse will get to be sponsored by the company they got accepted at. But if your spouse's visa is just Family Visit; and they landed a job with another company and you cannot have him/her under family visa; you just have to submit a No Objection Letter to transfer the sponsorship.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hi everyone; Very nice to meet you all. :) My wife and I are moving to Doha in about 3 weeks. As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone.

			<RelCText>Hi! Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if she know cooking etc. she can make delicious dishes and snacks. Also she can learn many languages through online it is free. she can improve her english through online studies. If she know painting or tailoring she can earn bit extra money by doing. If she had done any beautifican course she can join in any of the parlour. If she is found animals she can give some food and water to the street cats or birds. If you need a marhaba magazine i will give you a copy. Best of Luck and a pleasant stay in qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello! i guess it all depends on what kind of person your wife is. maybe she likes to exercise then she can go to aerobics classes n stuff.. she can do yoga or she can even go to Ezdan and get a package or sth for gym and swimming pool and stuff. and it also depends where you're stayig.. she can even sign up for a website (QL let's say) where she can learn stuff abt the country and news about the country... and she can make friends maybe. she can visit the musuems here when she comes but after some time what i metionned is pretty much all! hope she likes it here :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Lewis first of all;wellcome to Qatar in advance;you will slowly find out that Qatar is a nice and safe place to live and raise your family as well.The weather here in September is quite pleasant;but a bit humid.When you are in public;be sure not to wear clothes that offend local customs and traditions.Women can wear what they like but again;it shouldn't be too revealing or transparent.More importantly;to avoid unwanted attention from other men.You say you play football;you can join QL football group;you will updated on whats happenning around Doha;football-wise.And btw;which team do you support?. These are just a few tips you can find more here in this site using the search option.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>LewisHamilton; Here is an honest report: Be prepared to often put your patience levels beyond your limits in many daily situations. The driving here is insane and extremely risky. The professionalism levels are quite substandard when compared to the developed world. Services here are generally very poor. You will witness all around you; extremisms of social segregation and exclusion; where laborers and maids are marginalized and excluded from the main stream society. During the summer months (May to September) the heat is extreme; it can reach + 50 C. Many people leave Qatar and those who stay; stay indoors. During those months; life is all about work; home and shopping malls. No rain and sand storms instead. Your home and car will be covered with fine brown dust (as thin as cement or talc powder) when can damage your electronic appliances and your health. You'll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend (such as what you wear; what you say; what you drink and eat and when.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In private (hotel) beaches; both for men or women; there are no restrictions (just like elsewhere). In public beaches; for men there is no restrictions. For women; its not so much about the official restrictions; its more to do with the fact that many people (guys) are not prepared (educated) to behave in the presence of a women in a bikini.

			<RelCText>Mostly any beach in the Mediterranean Sea; some in Southeast Asia; South America and Australia... just kidding. Beaches here look nice in pictures but often there are not that great (mainly because of the sand which is earthy dusty and the extreme heat starting in May. Here in Doha city; they destroyed all public beaches and all we have left are the hotels (Intercontinental Hotel; perhaps the most popular; not necessarily the best as the beach is artificially prepared the sea floor is construction debris covered with algae. Recently they have built a series of artificial beaches; between the Intercontinental and the Pearl; in Qatara (a cultural village partially operating). The beaches are prepared to be public but they are subjected to a cover fee. All these beaches are artificial so expect dusty sand and sea bed with construction debris. If you want a natural sandy beach with the desert dunes in the back set; you need to drive to the Sealine (you need a 4x4). There are a few others s.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>From what you all have said; Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore; to enjoy and witness its natural reserves. Thanks for the share! I'm really waiting and seeking for answers of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure. hawaii snorkeling tours</RelCText>

I want to take my family for regular strolls at night. For those who have been to Abu Dhabi; I am looking for a park similar to the one opposite to Sheikh Zayed Mosque there.

			<RelCText>I think there is no park here that allows you to BBQ. . . not sure though but i havent seen any :( Corniche have these mini playground for kids. Katara is nice for sightseeing. You can BBQ at the beach but its a bit far from AlSadd though. Aspire park have a running path/track where you can jog. Now; to answer your question; i havent seen any park here where you can do all that; especially the BBQ thing :(</RelCText>

He really likes that stretch of grass; since the only real greenery he usually sees are desert shrubs :) I sometimes have to keep him on a shorter leash if anyone is out jogging or walking; but it doesn't seem like the area is frequented very much by others most of the times that I've been out there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well i usually walk my dog near the Gulf Cinema 'n walk like 2 km from there; i don't usually find people walking there so it's good for my dog coz shez scared of people specially kidz.... i used to go to corniche almost everyday to walk my dog; if u go at like 3 am on normal dayz you wouldn't find alot of people walking; but if u go there on a friday night you'll find it hard as all the kidz and people will be walking next to you or behind you... last thursday it was really quite there; usually there are lots of people on thursdays and fridayz...... but other non holiday dayz you wouldn't find alot of people...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>On our foreign ministry's site I read that it is absolutely forbidden to bring Rottweilers; Dobermann and Boxer dogs. Would be a pity so I'd have to leave my believed Rottweiler Kelly with my parents. Does anybody have a clue why this is so? Because they are considered dangerous? I mean a Pit bull would be more dangerous then those three races. (Yes I know; any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hands; even a Yorkshire; though there would be little reason to fear him.). Where would you buy dogs in Qatar? I mean; if I'd have to leave Kelly at home; I'd love to have some dog around to keep me company if there is no woman who'd volunteer for the job... *gg* Rene -------------------- think different.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar is no longer a safe place to live in when compared to what it was before. Seeing is believing. The other day my wife was just waiting for me to take the car out from the parking area of our flat( she was standing inside the parking area but she was busy on her mobile ) when a guy in a Honda Civic stopped and asked her to hop in. Do you call this safe. I have seen this happening to so many women in Qatar. No one is trying to scare away people it is the fact. Please open your eyes and dont go by statistics.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Bibs; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar. This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something…) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Saturday nights in Doha? Qube nightclub?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Is pretty good on a Thursday night. Nice crowd of people and a good British band. Not clubbing though.

			<RelCText>I agree with Tyler and bbksiu. Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi. So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Amaru Immortal - Clubs (I mean night clubs) here in Qatar are no comparison to what you'd find in a non-muslim country. They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. ""Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore. ""I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true?"" True. We go out on Thursdays. That's the weekend here. Happy hour starts at 5:30pm."</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hey guys have you been to Cube ? I think its cool its just At the back of Ramada Hotel its like a Night Club ! Though i think its hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just found last night while making a detour you know the traffic! While i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club...do you think its own by Ramada Hotel? anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>i went tuesday; i thaught it was pretty poor tbh; lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s. the design is interesting; nothing like a propper nightclub; far too bright; no disco lighting; very restrictive about upstairs couples/vip area. it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies-pretty synthetic and fake. i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a Bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke; and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11.30 yes its owned and staffed by ramada.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went on Thursday and had a good time with some friends. I thought the band was pretty good; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though. Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place. The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else; 10 guys to 1 girl.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well if thats what you want to go to the Doha night clubs for then thats your deal. Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in. Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs; what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them; in the case of Doha they will always be bad. Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>To the majority of people whom have attended real clubs; go for the music; to get dressed up to impress not only others but themselves. Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex. Real clubbing....IS.... music; dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion; there are many clubbing web pages; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum. Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing; not about picking up women!</RelCText>

Dvargas you didnt enlighten us with your wisdom of clubbing????? Anyone who knows about clubbing knows its not about standards; its about the music; the dancing the adrenaline! Not about pulling some sweaty speck who comes up to you with his checked shirt and fetching gold necklace! Thanks guys for making me giggle!! The cube a club he he he!!!</RelCText>

Nearly impossible to get into now if you don’t have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar. Serves champagne/cocktails and has a singer and piano player that play too loudly. Average drink price: 50QR Sherazad: The sports bar in the old Ramada. 70% men; Indian/Arab/Western. 30% Prostitute. .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here are the list which i found here in QL i just made copy and paste ^_^ LOL: Bars in Doha (Starting from Rugby Club moving to Marriott)including drink prices; average nationality of customer; musical tastes and % of prostitutes. Rugby Club: Similar to Garveys only maybe 60% British; not as many rig pigs and a lot more 16 year olds. Sometimes a DJ plays. Never seen any pros there either. Nearly impossible to get into now if you don’t have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar. Serves champagne/cocktails and has a singer and piano player that play too loudly. Average drink price: 50QR Sherazad: T.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ok; well there is Garveys; a british run pub. More casual. You can sit down talk and drink they usually have a band playing. There is also Palomas; however you need a female with you to get in. Aussie bar this is in Rydges hotel; same deal as palomas you need a woman with you. What sort of music you into? At the Diplomatic Club they get djs from all over the world. It is usually house music. They also have hip hop nights. Shit I think the Qube for males is about 80QRs; of course free for woman. Your right you know; we are treated with so much more respect here than in my home country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>mssahmed; you earn points by contributing; basically writing messages; answering to others. the point count show to others how involved you are and if you are a real identity (not a come and go once userid). This has the advantage of opening some doors to you; if you are willing to go through any. like 25 points is the minimum you need I happened to learn to be a member of the book club. otherwise I have not read (could have missed though) anything about getting a prize with your points. I wouldn't suggest it. Its the quality I want more than the quantity. dont you? ;) Burnout. Beware! :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are several good nursery schools with English as the primary language around Doha. My son when he was preschool age attended Mulberry Bush and then Doha English Speaking Kindergarten. A good friend of mine owned and ran these places but I don't think she still has Mulberry Bush. DESK was good though; my son enjoyed getting out of the house and making his own friends there. It's been a few years so I don't know about any of the teachers; etc that might still be there; or if my friend Louise Al Jaidah still owns the place; but you can call and find out. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The Westbay CC area is pretty small; so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building. (maybe a dozen buildings) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available. Personally; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club. Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice; but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors. The residences at the W Hotel are also quite nice; but no balconies.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Last beach in Doha city closed</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Damn...The beach besides the Intercontinental has been closed. The area has been set aside for a housing project. Why can't Doha; a seaside capital city of an aspiring tourism hub not have at least ONE beach? It was so popular amongst the residents. The same had happened to the one near the old Doha Club. Does anyone know any good beaches near the city limits?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>They are both good schools. Voltaire tuition fees are much more than Bonaparte. Depending on the age of your children you may find a place in Bonaparte; usually they do not have places.

			<RelCText>I have a 4yo daughter who will be 5 next September; I guess it's school time; so we are thinking GS (Grande Section) for her.

			<RelCText>Hi Tania; Good news for Voltaire; especially that I may be interested in living in Al Waab; I heard that housing is more affordable there than in West Bay and that it's a pretty nice neighborhood too.

			<RelCText>Just to inform you; even you choice the Voltaire or Bonaparte school; I just know the French nursery named Perles d'avenir; it's new one; but incredible fantastic ! I have my daughter there (26 months old) and she and I really love it ! If you need more details check their website : www.perlesdavenirqatar.com. About Voltaire; i know that they will open a second school; and they are a nice french school. If you are French you will have a big discount on it. I know that they provide a qualified french education and add with that the history/geography and arabic language to be adapted to the qatar. I think that an interesting addition ! Good luck to your choice.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I forgot to precise; bonaparte have a really limited available place in kindergarten; may be they are already full; you have to contact us before; in case of you could do the registration by distance. In other case; as voltaire will open a second school; you will have more chance to have available place. But you have to know that in qatar the registration in school; nursery ... is really difficult because there are too much children for a little number of good school. So do it as soon as possible !!!

			<RelCText>we are not french but Canadian; and I doubt they give any priorities to French Canadians. What i did is I sent a pre-admission request and I was told to wait until the commission decides. I don't know if this is the standard procedure or just a subtle way to say no? And besides I don't think I have a back-up plan as these are the only French schools in Doha; unless you can refer me to other schools? And my final question; in case nothing french works; do you think is it too late to put my daughter in an English school even though she doesn't speak English (she will be 5 years old at the school entrance)?

			<RelCText>Dono; I'm sure that you couldn't find in bonaparte because they have priority people. But; at 90% I'm sure that you could in voltaire. They have priority to qatari and French; but they open a second big school so they have lot of available places for now ! Try to send them an email; they will answer you ! For any english or other old school; it will really difficult to register your child; you had to do in advance; so inform you immediately; try to call few school and you will have an idea ! How old is your child ? Do he/she need to have an exam to enter in French shcool ? Do he/she speak French fluently ? Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Peter - I already wrote to Voltaire and was told to wait for the decision by the admission commission. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Voltaire as it looks like a nice school.

			<RelCText>I'm sure that the commission will be ok; they are well advanced in the process; and they speak to the radio that they will open the school. I'm not afraid by that.But I understood your situation; here the school are to much full; some companies do not accept anymore family because they can not be sure to assure a place at school. Don't worry for you and continue to keep contact with the school. I know that they like parent that insist; keep contact; want always news about the expected registration; ... Like that they will know that you are serious and motivate; so continue your email; your call... Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers...

			<RelCText>I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete.

			<RelCText>Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say ""I hope"" and ""I think"" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term ""no-brainer"". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us. PS: I am not critiquing or analysing your decision to buy. I am only seeking more information that you may like to share with us on your analysis. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've PM'ed Frog.  Is Rayyx the company that rents out the yellow buses?  How can I contact them?  Are they pretty clean and smell nice?  I'm taking around some people who would expect to be driving in pretty nice (like a Toyota Coaster). I've contacted a few bus rental places (Thrifty; al-Muftah) and their prices are around QR750.  Is it possible just to hire a private guy who drives a bus around?  Giving him a reasonable per hourly wage; QR400 should be enough.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Truth real estate should be called Lies real estate. I've started dealing with them and they seem quite bad.

They do have some good prices on the newer cars though. Just dont rent from Petra. They have lousy cars and they rip their clients off.

			<RelCText>Yes; you can buy and register car in your name although you do not have valid Qatari Driving License; but you should have valid R.P. I bought car in February; 2009 in my wife's name (though she does not have Qatari Driving License); when my sponsorship change was under processing and could not ask my existing sponsor to issue NOC to register car in my name.

			<RelCText>the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it. HOWEVER ; THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities; they will no longer issue you an NOC letter; and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported.

			<RelCText>I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Hamad Medical corp Salary</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance. Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english. Good luck! For Mr. Lucero; the agency that i know of is universal staffing services in makati located near south superhighway near border of makati and manila.

			<RelCText>Most of the play areas (Jungle Zone; Extreme world; Rays Reef) will do parties and I think you can specify food arrangements although most use the FF outlets. Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hey all; Just got to Doha from the UK under 2 weeks ago (hubby got a job here); which leaves me at home with my little girl. Can anyone recommend places to go; which are kiddy friendly; and where my husband and I can chill out too? We have been to the Villagio; Hyatt Plaza and Souq Waqif. Thanks! Shaz</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Personally; Qatar is a boring place. There's nothing really enticing place to go here. My advice to you is just stay indoors you'll be safe from rogue teenagers who'll beat you and from stupid drivers who drives like they have a date with Death. Zoo? you have that in your country. Beach? I bet your own country have better beach resorts. Water theme park? I don't think sharing a pool with someone who only takes a bath once in a blue moon is a bad idea. Museum? You'll learn more by surfing the net.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Doha has an overdone of sporting facilities! The Doha Asian Games are next year which means there are a lot of sporting facilities and events happening. Also; there are a number of sport and health clubs that you can join. Soccer is big here and the season is starting soon. Qatar has a number of big names playing in the local league (usually end of career European and South American players who are lurred by the big bucks). The ATP Tennis Tour also visits Doha and entrance to matches are free!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I personally think there's lots for a teenager to do here. I think it's mostly like most western countries with the exception of all the bad influences (No alcohol in grocery stores and such). Apart from the sports that have been mentioned a billion times; there are a lot of other ones that anyone may join and most of the time get coaching for free. Golf; archery; shooting and a lot of other ones that are completely free. For the not so sport oriented teen; there's the Scientific Club which is like a club that allows members to expand their scientific abilities. The Scientific Club will die out soon as the new Science and Technology park is opening up soon and lots of major corprations such as Microsoft and Dell are taking part in it. Movies aren't half bad either. The real blockbusters make it here within a week; while other not-so-good ones make it here in 2-3 weeks. There's also Alladin's Kingdom which is an OK theme park. Isn't as great as many others but it's OK. This won't last l.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1 yrs old would be too young for bday party i think. My son first birthday party was at home ... inviting his mammy and daddy's friend who have kids. I did his first bday party when he is 3 yrs old ... it was in Mc.Donald C ring road ... My son wasn't to keen joining with any activities. Hv a look at fun city on the top floor of centre point ... i like that place since it is clean. Others is the top floor of The Mall ; where the play area is ... they also do party for kids there with soft plays. But when it comes into distributing food don't think they can cope well ... the food come out too slow... by the time the last kids receive his/her food; the first kids already finished the meal.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hope what you are talking about is visit visa or tourist visa which would cost your friend from 500-1000QAR. Those visa can be converted to legal work visa once you find a job. But if what your friend is arranging for is illegal free work visa; please don't fall into the trap. It would cause a lot of trouble for you later.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; if they are flying in from the Philippines; the copy of the approved Business Visa will need to be sent to the Philippines where they can finalize the process to exit their country. Processing a Business Visa application in Qatar can take 1 day to 2 weeks; or more... Once a Business Visa is approved; the individual has 3 months to arrive to Qatar before the validity expires. If they do not arrive within 3 months; the entire process must be restarted. Once the individual arrived in Qatar; they can stay for an initial 30 days; extendable twice; for a total of 90 days before they will be required to exit Qatar. Hope this helps!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Manager's; Doctors; Accountant's; Engineers can get their visa upon arrival. In your case; I am not sure but I guess being a Finance Controller falls in the category as Accountant. I just been to Dubai recently and I got the visa upon arrival. I paid Dhs 170 for the visa with 30 days validity. Your Qatar Residence Visa should be valid still for more than 6 months to avoid any problem. Hope this tips would help you. Enjoy your stay!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>This question is probably going to be best for the Indian ladies. I find myself with a lot of leftover cucumber raita. Short of serving it on the side of rice and curry; does anyone have any suggestions of what to do with it? I seem to have over estimated the quantity required for last night's iftar and now there is WAY too much for me to eat by myself!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I thought it was a bit boring.     Beautiful decorations (heard they cost 60;000QR) ; tables; lots of sweets.   However it got started very very late  (left at11:00pm; dinner had not started)   Out of 300 women in the room I only saw I dress that I liked.   Most were garish and hideously gaudy.   Lots of Bright bright colors; feathers; sequins; etc.    TONS of makeup on.    They had a runway and a couple of women played the drums and wailed Arabic songs rather loudly.   Girls would get up and dance down the runway (so the older women could check them out as possible daugher-in-law contenders I've been told) Finally the lights went down about 10:00 the fog and light show started--sort of like a rock concert!   The bride then came out and walked very slowly down the runway.    Eventually people came up and showered her head with money.  She looked scared to death.  I learned she was 20 years old and had never met her husband-to-be; but had talked to him on the.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>from my experience; no matter how flamboyantly u dress up; its NOTHING compared to the Qatari ladies there. god; they r all so gorgeous; and their way of dressing up is amazing. cant afford (lol) ;)) abt the gift; no u dont take a gift to the wedding. usually i visit them few days after the wedding; n give a gift. wat happens during a weddin? well; make sure u sit away from the loudspeakers placed at all corners of the hall :-)) u can dance if u want; to the arabic songs being played there. hhhmmm;; n the food part; its yummy. u can starve for a few days after that to lose all those calories earned on that one evenin:-) its fun; ENJOY!! PS: oh yeah; like many others mentioned above; dont click any snaps. n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside. usually they hold it at the entrance. so be prepared to be disconnected from the rest of the world for the few hours u spent there..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>oh yeah; late dinner; depends on the arrival time of the bride n the groom. n by the way; the ladies get a chance to peep at the groom while he escorts the bride to the hall. unlike the men on the other side; who cant see who their friend/colleague is gettin married to ;)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Unfortunately; I have found Qatari weddings to be a bit depressing... I have yet to see it as a joyous occassion... I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason.... The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing... I had mine with me in the hall (it had been with me the whole night... I had to answer a phone call; and all of a sudden my phone was snatched out of my.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you haven't been to Doha before; you will have to be ready for some adjustments. Since this is a Muslim country; Christmas is celebrated mostly in private. It is not a public holiday. If you are a Catholic; there is a midnight mass here. Just check the schedule. Private dinner party/gathering is how most Christians do it here. There are also some hotel/restaurants that schedule events during the day or the eve. The same goes for New Year. Most locals and other muslims are very tolerant about Christians celebrating Christmas; some even join the New year celebrations. Just be well aware of the limits and keep your respect of the local culture.</RelCText>

You can decorate the house as we western people usually doing with Christmas tree; decoration around the house; Christmas flower; prepare a nice dinner (all the big hypermarket has nice special food for Christmas event.....even pork now in QDC).There are also many restaurants arranged a Christmas dinner with decoration; special food etc etc. We have spent 4 Christmas here and everytimes we got fun. Qatar is a boring place if you don't have friend or initiative but could be very interesting and full of fun if you are active person. Merry Christmas</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Things to do in Qatar for Eid</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hey! My husband and I have a week off next week and we have decided to stay in Qatar for the week. Does anyone have any suggestions for things to do? We have out own transport (it is a 4x4; but we're not too adventurous when it comes to venturing off road!!) Along with suggestions; your reviews; prices and directions where you can would also be appreciated! We want to spend the week as tourists; rather than expats; so all advice appreciated. Thanks :D Jayne</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I remember my Eid childhood. It was great. We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding. We'd all go from house to house; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal. After going door to door; we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast. Parents would usually chat. Families get together. People visit and they have some tea and snacks. We pray.

			<RelCText>Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid. Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey fitri; We moved here Oct 2004 from Dallas and it took roughly 60 days for our furniture and household goods to arrive. I'm not sure about your second question.

			<RelCText>I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"TATA are known to be a business house with solid Ethics.. TATA cars have proven to be success in Indian MArket. There Indica was the only car in India which challenged the dominance of Maruti Suzuki 800; which was enjoying the maximum market share. TATA NANO has shown to the world their Engineering superiority. Something even the Germans or Japanese Couldn Do. Safari is a Good Vehicle. But the problem in Qatar is - People are not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle does well on road... They follow the crowd... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese... You sell a toy car labelled ""made in America"" And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff.... Why you think Skoda is not a much accepted brad here very much like TATA.... First see the vehicle and then Comment.... If a vehicle can run on Indian Roads (sorry not roads.. supposedly roads) It can drive in any country ;... trust me...."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Bibs; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar. This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something…) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first of all you have to get your residence permit; afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license. if you already have a driving license from your country; take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it. no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school. if your license is from asia; it depends; but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test (signal; L and pocket parking; road test) or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here; what nationality are you? If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.</RelCText>

Pointing fingers will not change the fact that the majority of the drivers on the Doha roads are your compatriots; and the ""industrial"" (especially those who drive white TATA buses with workers) drivers shouldn't be given license even to walk."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Shreeya: sure; that's my point as well - they behave same here - i.e. drive 40 without observing lanes; turning where they want to; without indicating; jaywalking in the middle of the road. So when someone (not only a SUV at 120) but a car driving at 60 to 80 comes; the accident is inevitable. Just go to Najma in the end of the day to see the same. There are even kids playing in the middle of the street..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Terramax; People from all countries are residing in Najma area...there are Pionys; Pakistanis; Bangladeshis; Somalians; Egyptians and all others.;;why to blame it on only Indian drivers? The roads are so conjusted with the unique beautiful design of biiiiig roundabouts and smaaaaal circulating roads. Still I am yet to observe any big accident on these roads; believe me as I am a daily commuter on these roads. You have to agree the fact that behind every accident there is a SUV; fortunately not driven by subcontinent drivers.

			<RelQBody>I have been following up the World Championship in artistic gymnastics; and then there was a picture of a Qatari gymnast Aljazy Al-Habshi http://www.minkusimages.de/img/mi077_3d592d304d2ce26b96bc2260f69e2de1_52865.jpg Just would like to understand how does it comply with islamic rules of woman covering body and hair.

			<RelCText>It's really up to the individual...imho; she could have extended the leotard down to the knee and covered her head with the same outfit material to be a little more covered.

			<RelCText>"As far as I know FIG has certain rules with respect to leotards; and some years ago French team was fined for having their leotards too open. Same rules won't allow to use the outfit covering the whole body. Actually this Qatari gymnast does already have a special leotard with ""shorts"". The question remains - if she is doing something against islamic rules (and she does); how come she represents an islamic country? Don't you see there a contradiction? Will she be ostracized by let's say her schoolmates for showing her body in the public? Since religion and tradition are so interwaved in the Middle East I am just trying to understand where the personal preference ends and religious law begins."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>She would not be ostracised by anybody. It's really up to her and what she chooses to wear. I guess she believes that in the end she answers to Allah. Some say religious advice on clothing is law; some say guidelines. I think her family/husband have agreed with this choice of outfit; as has the Qatar team she represents. Not a big deal. Remember; she's wearing it in a sporting competition; not down the local souq. In all religions; the followers practise their belief in lots of different ways. For example; here in Qatar one sees Muslimas completely covered in black...face covered; black gloves on; the lot. Then you see other Muslimas in very figure-hugging outfits and lots of make up. It'a personal choice. ______________________________________________________________________ Love is the answer...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Would openly list countries where homosexuality is outlawed to be a vagabond nations. The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Bars in Doha (Starting from Rugby Club moving to Marriott)including drink prices; average nationality of customer; musical tastes and % of prostitutes. Rugby Club: Similar to Garveys only maybe 60% British; not as many rig pigs and a lot more 16 year olds. Sometimes a DJ plays. Never seen any pros there either. Nearly impossible to get into now if you don’t have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar. Serves champagne/cocktails and has a singer and piano player that play too loudly.

			<RelCText>OK; thats understandable; thank you. It also underlines mir83 and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar. However; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives; until something is said by somebody; and then the routine mass deportations take place. It goes quiet for a while; and then the 'night girls' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now. My last sentence; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this; 'mark my words; the ladies will vanish any day now. Over the few weeks after that; their numbers will slowly increase again; and the cycle repeats it's self'. Obviously somebody is behind this (a pimp); as a sponsor for these girls.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Cornellian; somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted. I cannot recall the poster; but it was suggested that some body in authority; possible with some 'wasta' to throw around; was probably behind it.

			<RelQBody>Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights?

			<RelCText>If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with Tyler and bbksiu. Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi.

			<RelCText>"Amaru Immortal - Clubs (I mean night clubs) here in Qatar are no comparison to what you'd find in a non-muslim country. They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. ""Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore. ""I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true?"" True. We go out on Thursdays. That's the weekend here. Happy hour starts at 5:30pm."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>unless ur visa is not printed on passport; u can easily change a sposor (NO NEED OF NOC). Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight &amp; visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Changing your profession on Residence visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My profession shown in my residence visa is Technician whereas in reality I am working as Manager. I tried to change my profession from Technician to Manager through our agent but for some reason he is saying it is not possible. I have Masters in Business administration and Masters in Geology. I really wonder why this change can't be done. Does any body has any suggestion of how to do this change?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>It is important; getting an NOC from sponser. First get the Application Form for Profession Change; get your sponser sign &amp; seal on that paper then goto Labour Dept(near to American Hosp) along with; 1) Sponser ID copy 2) Munciplaity Bill 3) Edu. Qual Copy (should be Transalted) 4) Bank Stmt(6 months) 5) Aggriment Contract (3 New) (newly printed) 6) Aggriment Contract (3 Old - Already signed) 7) Your PP ; Visa and ID copy. Submit this and get sign from officer he is sitting in 3rd Floor. Once you got the sign goto the nearest office for attestaion of your contracts.( new 3). while attestation you have to pay 50 QR. wait for another 10 days and got Immigration office(garaffa) and show your receipt from Labour by showing them the New Application for ID change with your photo. Then go Buiding no: 1 and submit your application there; you have to pay 300 QR. On the spot you will get your new ID and Visa sticker on your PP. Go Ahead good luck for you.

			<RelCText>What's the big fuss of changing your position on your VISA? Can you even READ what is written on your PATAQA? Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL?

			<RelCText>Hai guys I have been working in qatar since 1995 in a reputed company as a supervisor. The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>No Mr. Lincoln! its not a wiper fluid refill. Mechanically i am looking only at changing the timing belt and the axel boots in the front. I am keen to do cosmetic work on the cruiser. Complete body re-paint and polish...but i am looking for someone who does a really really neat job. Most of the paint shops out there just want to get the job done and are not overly concerned about the quality. As a customer; my top concern is the quality and finishing. Any suggestions guys? Any phone numbers would be appreciated. cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"my few experience : 1) I had noise on my Honda steering; plus steering was hard; i visited one mechanic in industrial area; he asked for QAR 400 for fixing... then i went to another mechanic; he asked for QAR 1500 ! said; i need to replace the entire unit including some belts (?)... then i went to third mechanic; and he found it was nothing... just power steering oil was to fill. and he fixed it in just 2 minutes and i was very happy to pay him QAR 50. my cost was dropped from 1500 to 50 Riyals ! 2) another incident; the vehicle was giving noise while putting in reverse gear. I went to the same mechanic who earlier had fixed steering problem just in 2 minute; and he asked for some checkup in German Computer. I did the checkup and computer gave an error code with description ""reverse solenoid blaa blaa blaa"". I presented the report to him; he said; the gearbox has to open and replace some switch inside and asked for the spare part from Honda + 500 Riyals for labour charge and 2 days tim....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks.

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yup; just got Titanium done last week after having a Pathfinder for two years. Makes a big difference and got it done for QR1700 and in 45 minutes. Very friendly and I went back the next day as thought I had bubbles in the windscreen. Hate to say it but they were right as disappeared after a week. Good luck; I got ours because of a newborn as well.

			<RelCText>I learned there are many types of Christian/Catholic in Qatar (Bible focus; Churches; International Church community; Baptism; etc). It is up to you. No one can force to change your religion; don't be afraid. We are all pray to the same God; the different are the way how we do it. There are no such force converting like you said. Religion is faith that comes from your heart; and what you feel in life. As long they teach good things which can make your life better; keep away from sin; it's fit for you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I believed that Christian Churches are limited in Qatar because a permission has to be approved and grant by the government just like I think what was happened in Catholic Church and other Christian Churches besides. Converting means from your own self. There is no hardway if you are sincere of going inside and converting to any religion. Just an opinion.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>the second stanza was a misleadibg question; but as what i undesrtand the question was : if there is any other christian churches are they difficult to attend to meaning are they recognized by the STATE OF QATAR? For the information only few sect of christians are recognized here on of which is catholic others ( who are not recognized) are not allowed to have a meeting or fellowship otherwise the police has the right to intervene.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Sharia and Arabic in expat schools</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Today's Gulf Times carried an article where recommendations were made to make arabic language and sharia compulsory in curricula of all expat schools in Qatar. How do QL'ers with school going kids feel about this? Make your opinions heard.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Expat schools here; at least the Western ones; DO teach Arabic. And Islamic studies. Islamic studies only for Muslims; of course. They also teach Qatari history; and that is mandatory for all students. Well; at least the school my child goes to does. I do not know about the non Western Expat schools.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>they should do that; why should i care about is he muslim or not-..u came to a muslim country islamic country nothing is gonna happen to ur dear child if he learns somethign except christianity. maybe it will be too much for their ignorant brains but it should be like that. i was born in germany and i went to church and i went to religious classes like all the other kids did. if u dont like it here u can leave but the minimum of respect is to send the child to learn about sharia and arabic. arabic is the language of the past and of the future..but i know where their problem is..affraid ur chidlren will convert will like it..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The way I look at it is like this. My child is enrolled in a Western school. My child is not Muslim. Of course he should learn about Islam; but not as something he needs to submit to; but something he should have knowledge about. The same goes for Sharia law. We do indeed live in an Islamic country; so it is important to be familiar with Islam. I like that Arabic is taught; the more languages a person knows;the better. The only problem I have is that so far all the Arabic teachers we encountered are totally useless.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>study Arabic or Islamic studies (which I understand from a Qatari friend includes an introduction to sharia). After all; isn't the basis of education to prepare one for life by providing a broad-based foundation from which one can later choose a specialty to focus on? Besides; I thought this was implemented from last year by the MOE.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Isobel said R.E ... In order to teach religion effectively there has to be comparatives. What I mean by this; when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion. If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions; in order to get the history; culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion. There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level; debate as in e.g. Islam and Christianity. Would that work? I think in ex-pat schools it may but in some local private schools; I doubt it. However; if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion; it could work......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I can't think of a good argument against learning the language of one's host nation (provided; as Isobel said; that a student can handle the academic rigors of such a class). Sharia? I'd personally have a problem with that being mandatory. Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion; it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class; say; for high school students. Then it would be appropriate. If instead of Sharia; you meant they should be teaching all children Islamiyat/Islamic Studies classes; then you'd get a vehement NO from me. Unless you're going to couch it in a ""comparative religion"" class that EVERYONE has to take; then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I don't subscribe to? I would be more than happy for my child to take a class on ""history of the Middle East and the Islamic World"" or ""Arab cultural studies"" (and much like an A....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The chicken or the egg causality dilemma arises from the expression ""which came first; the chicken or the egg?"" Chickens hatch from eggs; but eggs are laid by chickens; making it difficult to say which originally gave rise to the other. To ancient philosophers; the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began. 1 Cultural references to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"In a manner of avoiding the question or joking; it can be said that ""the chicken"" came first—in the structure of the question; simply because the words ""the chicken"" are said before the words ""the egg"" when the question is asked. In a question that is phrased differently; the answer would be different. Similarly; Randy Garner jokingly refers to an encyclopedic solution:[18] “ These supporters call attention to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (2001). Upon careful examination of the entries and accompanying definitions; one can accurately assert that “chicken” is found on page 232; while “egg” is not found until page 398. Therefore; according to this argument; chicken clearly comes before egg. ”"</RelCText>

My Canadian license has long since expired; but I have been on my UAE license for the past 5 years.

			<RelCText>first of all you have to get your residence permit; afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license. if you already have a driving license from your country; take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it. no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school. if your license is from asia; it depends; but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test (signal; L and pocket parking; road test) or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin; you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist; for a small fee).

			<RelCText>robherr soft ; No worry; My visa is cancelled in July -2011; still I am in Doha with my UAE on arrival visa and driving my Car which is registered under my friend name. whenever you need to go to the Traffic dept. (in case any accident) show the visa stamped page to them. you can drive until ur License expiry date. I posted this reply from my experience; within this period I met three accident and never ever faced any problems from Traffic Dept. Don’t care the above replies which have no sense; if any help need contact me</RelCText>

			<RelCText>dude; I came here on a visit Visa. Screw the car rentals; you think they know anything? I went to Traffic department and asked. #1 - Not all international licenses are valid. Only ones from certain countries and they have to come with a booklet that contains a card. #2 - No matter what your status is; It is allowed to drive on it for 2 weeks from the time you enter the city. After 2 weeks if you get into an accident; it is your fault no matter what. Car rentals don't tell you these things because you are buying their insurance anyways! #3 - International License means nothing without your original license from back home. When you want to make the Qatar License; you NEED your original license from back home and it has to be recognized so that you don't go through the driving tests in here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if its parallel parking I can tell you what my driving instructor taught me: drive up parallel to the car in front of the spot you want to park in; about a foot away from it. reverse straight until you can see the boot of the other car through the back door window then turn the steering wheel and straighten it back up as you move. when the back; driver side corner of your car is in line with the car behind you; turn the wheel the other way and viola!! you slide right in.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>First prepare yourself and ignore the police when he shout so you don't feel nervous. Make sure you don't knock over any pole. Begin Reverse 2 inches away from the pole in your right hand side. When you don't see the first corner of the pole of the parking box covers by the part of the car; take a full turn to the right. Adjust your mirror on the left hand side down to see the white line; then reverse slowly. When you see the white line in the middle of the left back wheel; take a full turn to the left then move slowly then you will be inside the pocket parking. I hope it helps!!!

			<RelCText>Among GCC states; it is understood that; anyone with a GCC driver's license can temporarily drive in any other GCC states but if the individual will have permanent residence then he has to secure a local DL. securing the local DL is the culprit in a lot of confusions. I have a UAE (abu dhabi) DL gotten on Dec. 1993 and expiring this Dec 2008. when i moved here in qatar on Dec 2004; i used my uae driver's license when i was still on a business visa. After i got Qatar RP;I applied for a Qatar DL at the Traffic Department. I submitted my original UAE DL for inspection and then they required me to have an eye test only. After passing the eye test; i was issued a Qatar DL In some GCC states; I hear this is not the case; for example; here in Qatar I hear that they do not recognize Saudi DL? Some GCC states requires DL applicants (even with applicant with GCC DL from another state) to undergo driving schooling;driving test to secure the local DL.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

			<RelCText>Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"dogs in Islam are acceptable so long as they serve a ""purpose"". In my own home; they provide security. There are steps to take in the Muslim faith so that dogs are allowed (concerns washing dishes; the person if touched; etc.) My main concern is that this has been allowed to be interpreted as dogs are ""haram"" - and some people take this as a reason to be cruel and abusive. One (western) person I know said that this was due to ""Arab cruelty"" (his words; not mine); I in turn replied ""I feel sorry for those who think lke that (and you) because some people (and not just those of the Muslim faith) do not know how much security and real affection dogs can give - they are always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotions. All they ask is sufficient food; water; to be treated without pain or hurt; and a few kind words."""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The health certificate needs to be within one week but the vaccine has to be given at least 30 days before travel. It's not recommended to breed and sell puppies here - there are far too many irresponsible people who get bored and abandon them. Come down to the rescue shelter when you get here and you'll see the number of pure-bred dogs that were abandoned because they got too big; or too energetic; or because their owner was going on vacation!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>He's going to his new home this weekend. Why do you want a labrador? Have you had experience with this breed before? Labradors are far from easy to keep and need a huge amount of exercise so they don't get destructive. Have you had dogs before? Where will it live? Have you thought about what you will do when you go on vacation? Or leave Qatar for good? Have you looked into all the costs involved with having a dog - from adoption fees; vaccinations; food; boarding kennels etc.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it. HOWEVER ; THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities; they will no longer issue you an NOC letter; and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario. This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. I'm not sure if the procedure changed.</RelCText>

She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Kat yep very true about the type of work you are experienced in; if the position can be filled local the mindset is.....why hire a American that will want more salary then a different nationality? Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day. IF your CV is eye catching and has what they need; you will get a call for interview.</RelCText>

No doubt Qatar is good country to work and live here but I am not kind of slave or something to work for money only even I am getting a handsome salary here too...

			<RelCText>I would advise you to pick a different place. Many people will view you as nothing but a prostitute in Qatar. Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month. Plus they aren't going to pay you what you're worth because you are Chinese. Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here. Not fair; I know. If you do go...don't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom. I hope this helps. Sage</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Honestly; if you want to enrich your life then Qatar is the worst place I can think of; honestly. Qatar is the definition of an empty shell. Nothing of substance here whatsoever. Here you have an entire displaced foreign population - all here for working only! There is no culture here. Work is the culture. As for the geography...the worst found anywhere in the world. No trees; no rivers; no lakes; no mountains; lots of traffic though; terrible climate; etc. etc. Combine that with no fun at all; unfair pay based on your nationality; and the surrender of your passport. If that is your idea of enriching your life... go for it!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Lots of jobs.... Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality. Qatar taxes income by housing rent (50% mininum) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent (even if it increases). You will need QR 1000 for food &amp; other expenses if single. Anything above that you can save; depending on how much you want to save. I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent; else you would be really wasting your time and youth. Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries.(SriLankans &amp; Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low.) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction. 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into. The second is not a boom its a BLAST. Theres always jobs in Construction Companies. All other services are growing.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This is a complicated society but it can be very enriching. Try spending a weekend in the desert with a Qatari family; attending a Magilist; learning Arabic; learning to dive; going fishing and sailing with Qataris. I have done all of these things. It is not easy to make the connections; you have to make the effort but like many other things in life; the more effort you make; the better the rewards. I think you do most things here that you can do anywhere else. I admit; I miss mountains and climbing and greenery but there are plenty of good things here and some very fine people. Just go and out and find them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Undoubtedly you can experience new things and enrich yourself in Qatar; as in any other country for that matter; but the question here is another in my opinion. We cannot pretend there are not issues in this place; specially if you carry the ""wrong"" passport; so I think it is fair that Maggie gets the full picture; both the rosy and the dark side of Qatar. Then she can make up her mind."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Fact : If your company terminates you; take that letter to your bank ; you won't be required to pay any remaining amount ; bank will use its tacts ; don't yield ; after few days of delay ; finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home .. Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My start was that I went to the department of Islamic Affairs and got a bunch of books including the Quran. I started reading at 11am and did not stop until 11pm. I immediately knew that this was the religion for me; eventhough I was highly sceptical when I started reading.... I have read so much since; learned by talking to other Moslims; taken some courses; but my thing is reading so I did that the most. I suggest you talk to some other new moslims. It will be easier as the questions you have are the same questions they had. When I started there were not many people I could approach; nor where there any centres as such and I talked with moslims by birth and they had a hard time understanding my questions. Ofcourse if I can help; let me know! Aisha-Taweela</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It is not a question of easy or not. Converting to Islam is not just saying; Hey world I think I will become a moslim. No it is much much deeper. It is a question of a total change in lifestyle (in my case at least) It has more to do with your innerself. How you look; approach and accept what is in your life. I can tell you it did better than going to a phychoanalist. You learn so much about your self; about the purpose of you being there; about the purpose of living; about the purpose of hardship. Islam should not be hard on you. But it is how hard you make it on yourself. Aisha-Taweela</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Science assumes that the universe started with a singularity; where there was nothing..nothing at all. Then logically; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows. I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity. Further; the 'anti-matter' and 'negetive energies' are still theoretical concepts. If the same are proven someday; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all. But; at present; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes; neutron stars or white dwarfs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Would openly list countries where homosexuality is outlawed to be a vagabond nations. The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.</RelCText>

I don't think the West is scared at all about polygamy. They simply don't approve of it in their societies. It's their right; isn't it?

			<RelCText>Why is drinking alcohol considered a crime in the middle east? Crime in what sense? what if the drinker agrees? And is cheating on your beer/having a permanent vodka besides her considered an equally serious crime? and why? Why is alcohol prohibited; while smoking and underage marriage are being legalized? It is said that even in some christian countries; alcohol is limited; so why is the middle east so scared about it? What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

			<RelCText>it's not only in the west but also on some countries in the east that polygamy/ bigamy is outlawed. the reason is simple; it is illegal in the new testament (bible). i'm not sure what's the reason for buddhist countries like thailand &amp; singapore to adopt monogamy though. for muslim countries like malaysia and indonesia; it is common for muslims there to marry only one. cultural convention; maybe.. in my country; adultery/ concubinage is a serious crime. but it is a crime that is so hard to find evidence of:-) usapa na...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Polygamy is not a crime; you just can not be married to multiple individuals which has become a standard that derived from Judaism/Christian values. As time progressed and the consequences form multiple partners slowly revealed itself; std's HIV and such; we can conclude that this has been the right approach. Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples' clubs; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular. Prostitution in some countries is legal; some not. As goes for me governments should legalize prostitution and register all that practice; create labor unions and tax them over their income. Why? This cuts the throat of crime; represses human trafficking and serves a purpose in society. The same goes for soft-drugs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>kamusta kabayan? to sum up all the process required by the SCH Qatar; you need these 4 very MAJOR important things. 1. Passed the Prometric Exam 2. minimum 2 years paid hospital or clinical experience (volunteer isnt counted and considered) 3. BS Nursing Degree holder 4. Registered Nurse (with active license not expired) in your home country The evaluation which will be conducted by Dataflow is just one of the steps for you able to get licensed here. FYI; Dataflow doesnt need your Prometric Exam in the Evaluation Stage. Dataflow will only needs the 2;3&amp;4. Once u've passed the Evaluation; you will proceed to Licensing Stage. For you able to pass this stage; you need to PASS the PROMETRIC</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Supreme Council of Health also dont know if you can pass either the evaluation or the exam. SCH is a government health agency here who contracted and rely to these 2 private agency (DataFlow and Prometric) to verify your credential(DataFlow) and to test your nursing knowledge and skills(Prometric). They let you to take the exam becaause Evaluation results takes time to finished (sometimes more than 6months). SCH wanted you to sit for your Prometric while waiting for the result probably because 1. they assume that you could pass it and 2. if you failed; at least you have time to retagke it while waiting for the evaluation result</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license. Private clinics are very strict on accepting new nurse applicants. Your lucky to practice your profession with license here; but beware my friend...

			<RelCText>Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>thanks gt. lucero. i applied in Unistaff agency. it is located in Boyle st palanan makati city; presently they are hiring nurses with 3 yrs of experience in special areas like ICU; OR or ER. Hamad work sounds good. hows the working condition of pinoy nurses there in qatar?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english. Good luck! For Mr. Lucero; the agency that i know of is universal staffing services in makati located near south superhighway near border of makati and manila.

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>huhu.. the name of position also different; sure they will earn different QR every month. I heard Arab Saudi can offer better salary . The basic is equivalent to RM10;000. Many nurses from Hospital Johor Bahru working there since the first group explore the opportunities. I am also from health background but bye.. bye.. MOH. In term of RM i got 20X better than what they can offer me. If me; with the offer that Qatar can give us; better to stay malaysia; get a degree; and apply for Nurse Manager in malaysia @ overseas. It is not easy to live here (Qatar) without David &amp; Kids and not worth to leave them behind with the such offer. Normally Malaysian put RM15;000 for oil &amp; gas practisioner as a minimum salary per month. &amp; others sector is RM 10;000.00. OTHERWISE; better to stay home !!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello; I'm a Biomedical Engineer hired by unistaff also last June 12; 2012. I got a call from unistaff that my visa is already with them. I went for my medical last Sept. 20; 2012. They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

			<RelCText>Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand</RelCText>

Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him..

Do Western men over here (and everywhere else) have a preference towards Asian women or is just a coincidence that I see alot of these couples around? Anyone have any idea ?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Good topic for discussion though... We always want what we don't have... and the very fact that the Western Men are used to seeing the same type of women all around them; makes them want something they don't have; i.e. the small petite asian women... besides; most of the western men have been thru a marriage earlier and then have asian women... reason being-because they are more homely and like being 'stay home moms' rather than pursuing a career in the West. As far as the Asian Women are concerned; yeh the thought of a better; cleaner and quality life; attracts them more towards the western men... I'm talking general over here... to prove my point; try taking a peep at one of the Cyber Cafe's in Manila or Cebu and you'll see all of them women on webcams talking to a wester man hoping something will click. The same is the case for Asian men... most of them would love to have a Western Woman; but having to work their way to get to that and maybe the thought of failing; makes them wanna .....</RelCText>

I mean it's like buying something off e-bay or amazon... lol! Also if you see in Bangkok or Phillipines; you always find western males (mostly over 40) there in search for an asian woman to marry... now it's a different story that not all of them marry! ------------------------------------------------------------ 250 QL points and moving up!!!

			<RelCText>"Considering nationality; income etc is a smart thing to do IMHO. Nationality differences can lead to disputes about where you will live; if it is accepted to the family; if you will be able to get your spouse into your country and many more. As for financial status; love is great but it doesnt pay the bills. I for one wouldnt want to have a future with someone if we didnt have a pot to p*ss in or a window to throw it out my entire life; but I guess thats just my female gold digging instinct. I love the fact that someone stated that we girls/ladies are the only ones who see their potential partner as an investment. _____________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>brit.. i'd add to your list: a real love is UNRETURNED one.. if we love with the condition that he/she loves us in return; it is already Conditional love.. how many times we hear: ”Oh; he is bas**rd; he doesn't give you what you deserve; LEAVE HIM”.. it is initially wrong.. if you are with the person just for RECEIVING what you “deserve”; it is not love.. It is a contract...love is GIVING without expecting anything in return.. The PEAK/TOP of pure love is when you keep loving the person even knowing you will never get anything in return; and even knowing you will never be together… This is a real LOVE with NO DOUBTS.. ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”.

Batman; a provisional driving licence-holder; was found to be over the drink-drive limit. Superman; who held a full driving licence; was also breath-tested and found to be the same. Both men have now been charged. The pair were among 15 people who were arrested in Fife as part of a clampdown on drink driving. Fife Police said the pair of superheroes were stopped near Anstruther in the early hours of Sunday morning. The two men; both in their early 20s; were on their way home from a fancy-dress party when they were ordered to pull over. A source at Fife Police said: ""This is a real fall from grace for two superheroes. I am sure drink driving is not allowed in Gotham City; and it is certainly not to allow....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I think no one will sale a large amount for that; if you really need it; you should have taken a permit first from ministry of Health or elsewhere. Silica is if i am correct is derived from the element or a substance like acid or solvent and in that case; any large amount is questionable by authority; because; some might be used for making something destructive; if you know what i mean; or something use by sniffers??? I am not really sure of what i said; but; one thing is sure; if you need it in big quantity; you should have taken a permission from authority..   "" There's nothing we can do to change the past; if it teaches  you a lesson profit from it then; forget it."""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Vma; in Nagaland(India); they feed the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer. Then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it becomes sick and throw up. They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts. And BTW; they eat dogs;crows;rats etc in some parts of the north east too. So ""dog meat curry"" and ""dog puke"" is an Indian dish. I have heard that other Asians like a some Koreans(not all) and some Japanese eat ""dog meat"" too. Exotic food is popular in many Asian country. But Filipinos do it ""field rats"" and ""snake meat""; if I am not wrong!"</RelCText>

Or else if you have plenty of time in hand order online. Just keep in mind while placing an online order that you have minimum of a month and a half before your wedding.

			<RelCText>I am an UK national and have a great position and great pay; thus i don't believe that will be a problem. I can sponsor my husband that is not a problem. Would he be able to work at his current firm under my sponsorship; or apply for a new job. If he gets a new job; he can transfer from my sponsorship to his new comp. I know people who came on wife's sponsorship and looked for a job and transferred thier sponsorship to thier new employers once they got a job. But that person did not have a job or previous sponsorship. Our case is different; cause he has a current sponsorship. Only reason why we want to switch is so that he can have some freedom to choose. This whole release thing is like torture.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if that is the case; then; i can ask my husband for the change sponsorship. i am sorry but i got one more question. beofre; i was not able to transfer from visit to husband sponsor because his salary is only half of what the standard requirement of qrs 10;000 for residents under family sponsorship. my kids who were under visit finally received their RP when i got an RP from my employer. THE last question now is; with the same salary my husband have; plus my work visa which i intend to transfer to husband; what is the possibility of the husband transfer? thank you so much for your kind attention and detailed answer. really appreciate your good soul.

			<RelCText>You won't get an approval if your husband's salary is below 10;000...the reason behind it is you cannot live comfortably if your whole family is with you; and the head of the family earning only 5;000. Way back 2007; the limit is minimum 7;000...2010 onwards; they raised it to 10;000 due to higher cost of living. You cannot add wife's salary to make the 10;000...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>u need to fill the transfer form and need salary certificate from ur husband company ; if he can make for 7 k or more will be better . u must take ur father original id and ur original id and ur husband orignal id with u . also merriage certificate and ur and ur husband passport copies must be attached also with forms . and it take maximum 1 hour in main immigration to transfer the sponsor ship from father to husband .. one important thing once u fill the form u need to verify signatures from any police officer of immigration and he will stamp the paper then only they will accpet ur form to transfer the sponsership.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was not allowed to sponsor my husband on family visa either. Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"LP ?? ""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Lots of things to check in buying used car; better bring a trusted mechanic with you; under carriage noise is easier to resolve than unusual engine noise so becareful; if you want to check combustion efficiency of a car; check the tail pipe; it must have no oil; and in the morning when you start up the engine for the 1st time; if water condenses out of the tailpipe they say this is a good sign as to engine combustion; i'm sure there are lot of other things you should check; so research as well...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Be warned!!!! the worst car dealership i have had the misfortune to go to is the Nissan dealer. Granted; nissan have a great line-up of cars but the poor service of the dealer has made it no joy to own a Nissan. my view; considering best value and quality and after sales service. best 4x4 - toyota (LC or Prado) best luxury saloon - mercedes e class best economy family saloon - maza 6; toyota camry best economy compact - maza 3; toyota yaris worst--- hummer...ssangyong (eg rexton)... anything european (except merc.

			<RelCText>I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible.. THEY DONT SERVICE THE CAR AT ALL..JUST DO OIL AND FILTER CHANGE ALL THE TIME... ASK THEM FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL TALK OF A SCHEDULE OF LEAVING THE CAR THERE FOR FEW DAYS (USUALLY 3 DAYS)... IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM??

			<RelCText>you can't go wrong with either car; however; the Camry is bigger. You will get good resale for any Toyota. And an older Camry is nothing to worry about; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You'll probably die long before your Camry does haha</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy; has a full service record and stay away from cars with unknown histories..a car is only as good as its maintenance and even a Camry/Corolla has to depend on its owner to take care of it. You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr. they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car.. Best of luck</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>I'm looking to by a new car; but the local GM dealer is useless and looked at me like I'd asked for a turbocharged donkey when I said I wanted a manual gearbox.

			<RelCText>Hi Alan; you might wanna re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4% as compared to approx 9% for a personal loan. If you check with manager (not sales guy) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you. I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too. Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead. With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go (just my oponion)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Mandilulur; ignore the profile; its nonsense. I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum. My name isn't Alan either; but it'll do for this forum :) B2D; driving is always fun; I love cars; always have. Plus its an adventure; never done it before :) Cy; I know about the rates; but the actual monthly payment costs aren't too different; yes I pay more overall; but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want. I'm a Brit; I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear. I bought the car; I'll decide when to change. Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show; and they still aren't as good as a manual box. The wannabe Schumacher's of this world can have them; I'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks. Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox; not a sodding computer. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>its was rather weird when I saw your exact name on one of my twitter followings.... apparently you are Katy Perry's favourite comedian;-P I have to agree with you on manuals... yes; I am a chick; but I do know a bit (very small amount) about cars... I also drive a manual and when I went to buy it and insisted on it; the salesman was surprised that I would ask for manual over auto... Besides what you have said regarding manuals... they are also easier to push start should the need arise;-P</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello guys;Im a filipino physiotherapist. parents should not be ashamed of having a child with special needs.If they dont do something about the condition of their child;they deprived the rights their child to have an education. In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam;its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future.

			<RelQSubject>Child dies in School bus in DPS</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Today children returned late from School (DPS -MIS);the reason being a child was found dead in the school bus. From what I heard; the child dozed off in the bus during her morning trip. The driver did not notice and the child was left in the bus. They found her in the afternoon ;it should have been the heat in the bus that killed her. She was just 4 years old. Did anyone hear about this ?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>This news seems true and school has expressed condolences and a holiday tomorrow. Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>it sucks. If you do wish to bring your kids up in the malayali culture; then this is the school to enroll your future malayali citizens. The teachers talk strange and expect the children to excel in their forte... you know; the 'simbbly sduupeed; gelf male-ya-lee egg-scent' Depends on what you want to bring your kids up as... supermarket staff or elite!

			<RelCText>Frankly speaking; all pakistani schools suck . as none of them have any standard if we compare them to the Indian schools. However; out of the available one; Bright future is the best. DO not go for a lower fee paksitnai school as PEC would be the lowest. If you can afford; get your children in private school like Cambridge etc or otherwise Bright Future is the best.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are three Pakistani schools here in Qatar.. PEC; Pakshama and Bright Future and to be honest; they all suck big time. I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it wasn't so bad that time. We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good. But then somewhere end of the 80's or beginning of 90's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months. I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly. They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation. In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened. I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two. I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good.. MES Ideal Indian School Shantinekatan DMIS DPS By the .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My eldest son is at Bright Future Pakistani. Honestly; I am not satisfied with the school. They dont have good standard. My son is having problem with his study there. Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also. They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids. lack of creativity. Too much URDU Lesson (which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework). If you lucky; your child will be teached by skilled teacher (my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school). Unfortunately this year for grade 1; he's stuck with unskilled teacher :( Indian school? yes they are good; but very difficult to get space. We've been trying for a year now. NO LUCK !! Other international Schools? They suck our blood out ! One thing good is that we can afford the fee of BFS. (My husband is a Pakistani but I am not)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Somehow I am not sure what makes a good school. As a parent you have to decide whether you want a school which gives emphasis to extra-curricular activities or academics or a nice mix of two and than go ahead with your questionnaire. As far as the quality of teaching is concerned; teachers are the same as India as they have a work experience from India.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi. This depends your point of view about education. MES and Ideal Indian schools are quite old ones and they are reasonably good in the academic side. If you send me a private message I will be able to give you more details about MES. There are number of new Indian schools coming up these days with more facilties for students but less number of students.Their ratio of students teacher is 25-30:1.I think you may choose one of them. DPS;MIS;BPS and so forth. Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Brother don't worry and contact the respective agents of your after couple of week. As per some agents in Qatar initially embassy issue the visa only for the locals &amp; residence of Qatar &amp; after one to two weeks Saudi Embassy will start issuing the visa for the family those who are on Visit. I am also waiting to get the response from the agents but even I heard we need to give them the prior hotel booking to get the visa; this is applicable for those who just need Umra Visa. Those who are going through Agents using their transportation &amp; accommodation doesn't required to show the hotel booking. Lets pray for Allah to may everything easy for all of us.

			<RelQBody>My sponsor; who is my brother; recently applied for a visit visa extension for me. It was approved and I was extended for another 4 months. But the thing is the visa extension is just a printed form and not a sticker that should have been posted in my passport. Anyone who can comment on this? Is this really the new system?

			<RelCText>there should be small white sticker attached in your passport that has the date of entry to Doha and the expiry date (or your visa extention date). so that incase police checks the validity of your stay in Doha; it will be easier. better visit immigration office in madinat khalifa to validate the authenticity for your own safety.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Do you mean that they will see if it's an urgent case they will accept ; and if not they will not ? I am wondering is it so easy to meet the captain !!

			<RelCText>In general the higher the price the newer and better the house/apartment. However note that some new houses have high rents ('cause they're new and big) but are located in crap areas! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR; and many of those places already have waiting lists. Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries. There's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates; it's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere. If your employer won't take care of it; best is to come here and take a look by yourself... Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Luciano From my experience the cheaper places (7-8k a month) have lower quality than the more expensive places (18k for a 2 bedroom). However; do not expect to see excellent quality on the expensive places either because you won't.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Accommodations of higher rent like 15k to 25k per month will be in better quality than the cheaper ones. It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent. I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities. There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The cost of living here is cheap! Although when we talk about rentals for apartments/villas/flats it is expensive. Grocery items are priced reasonably and is affordable and worth. Eating at restaurants more than once a week is fine (restaurants that are not fine dine). Clothing. There are many store here to choose your clothes from. There are many stores inside the shopping mall that is more often than not that sell on sale. Cosmetics. Well I'm a boy and so I don't know much about these but I see most women here wear make up always so I think the price is tolerable. Obviously the prices of oil and gas here is cheap. So overall; living here in Doha is cheap.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I agree 100% with Ralph; the 1st post. Housing is very expensive; although it's coming down very fast. I just signed a lease on a villa for 10500QR/mth(~$2900USD). It's brand new; 2 stories; 4 beds; 3 1/2 baths; huge rear patio; covered parking; pool; clubhouse; close to Villagio Mall. You can get furnished 2-3 bed apts for 6500-9000Qr/mth (~$1800+) all over the place nowadays. Groceries are cheap for the most part. Only certain ; select items are really expensive. Petrol is practically free here. Utilities (if you have to pay them at all) are very cheap. The best place to buy clothing is on the internet or wait for a sale in the mall stores. Other household items and appliances are very reasonably priced as well. As someone mentioned; it really depends on your income and usual standard of living. The 'general labor' ex-pats will find it extremely expensive. For you and anyone looking for the best car rental rates from a professional rental company; I would suggest using ""Strong Rent-A....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>mr. qatar-engineer seems more like the salesman at Strong rent a car. Anyway; Qatar is one of the most expensive countries to live in. Agreed; this is not the case if your housing; schooling; etc are paid. But groceries are obv much more expensive than every country I have been to (except Japan). Since qatar does not have income tax; assume you are taxed about 30% of your salary when you go to buy food; cars; groceries etc.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I'm just trying to save ex-pats from the pitfalls I faced when I landed here awhile back. It wasn't until I found Strong that I realized I was being screwed on car rentals. Groceries are not as expensive as Kuwait or Bahrain (both countries I have lived in recently). Perhaps you just haven't lived in too many other places to judge prices properly....? just a thought...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have lived in Europe briefly; and of course my native Australia. I lived in Abu Dhabi 2 years prior to coming here. In comparison to Abu Dhabi - much the same for groceries; cheaper for accomodation. As a general rule; petrol and cigarettes; and consumer durable products are much cheaper here than Australia &amp; Europe. Groceries are much more expensive; as they are imported. However; and ironically; I have been paying less for Australian lamb &amp; beef here; than when I left Australia. Mick</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you like to imbibe as I do (and it seems Mr Paul does though why he comes to Qatar rather than BAH is a mystery) then it is much cheaper in Bahrain.

			<RelCText>I lived in Bahrain for 17 years. Accommodation is cheaper; but everything else is almost the same. I'd say on average its a bit cheaper. Of course you do have less variety.  When it comes to upper class fun; it's around 50BD per person for full three course meal with a bottle of wine or date juice plus belly dancer. It's around 60BD in Qatar. ___________________________ Click here for Qatar info</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you can have a public health insurance in doha for 200QR.... if you are looking for higher health coverage; you will be talking about 1500-3000QR a year (private hospitals) anyways; health services are available for quite affordable prices in doha; I have been living here for 3 years now; thank god; I have not needed any serious medication; but as I hear from the guys it is not that expensive (considering that doha is TAX FREE country) if you are looking for teeth insurance... (in can range from 150-250 riyals per tooth for normal teeth rust fixing); but if it is a surgery... then it is 500 riyals and above per tooth.  dont worry about it.... it is steaming hot here and you will like it :P</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am from England and i think we have a similar National Health system there than Australia so I think I know where you are coming from.  I was also a nurse back home so I have formed my opinions of the health service here based on this.  Qatar has a NHS that is available to all residents once you have paid 100QR for a health card that gives you a patient number. This entitles you to emergency treatment; routine referrals; surgery etc. It is not free at the point of delivery but an outpatient appointment is 50QR for the first appointment then 30QR each visit. Overnight stays depend on the type of ward you choose; single room; semi private (2 beds) or ward (4 beds).  I had an op here and was in a 4 bed ward and it was fine; cost 100QR for 2 nights.  The health service is based on the American model and is regulated by a Canadian company as far as I know so all issues with culture; confidentiality; patient rights are similar to the experience I had in the UK.  Thee are 2 private hos.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"our kids were there last year; but we have transferred them to a cheaper and better school. Can't say where as 'someone' will work out who i am. Kids did ok; but were not at all challenged. Biggest issue is the student mix and the site. It's too small now (around 200 kids I understand); so they have lunch in the classroom and take turns at playing outside. Quality of ed. is basic. Owing to language difficulties; (loads of Dutch and Danes) it's lowest common denominator stuff. But if your kids are bright; even the schools that are 'closed' will interview and test. Ours are now going to one that has been full for 4 years; but we didn't have to wait as they did v well on the entrance exam. Hamdulillah. And the fees? As said above; ""because they can""..."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. keep yourself busy with work. don't mind your others as long as your boss is happy with what you are doing. 2. less talk less mistake. never disclose any of your personal things. the more they know about you; the more they have something to talk about. 3. avoid having too much personal calls and chatting during office hours. they can also look after this. 4. if you want to join with their chats during break time; give them a good story on what happened to your former officemate whom you slammed after you knew she / he was backbiting you. scare them. Show them you are not tnat kind and better for them to be very careful with you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ask for 13;000 housing and also a list of schools they will pay for when your child becomes school age (or allowance of 45;000 for schools if you agree to stay that long).

			<RelCText>for starters; it is a good package and i believe you should take up the offer. You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios</RelCText>

			<RelCText>it depends upon the position; for ex; i know for a fact that a candidate was rejected becasue he couldnt spot a shade of green properly; he wasnt colour blind; there was a lot of defence for his case; but he was rejected because he couldnt recognise a shade of green. here it probably mattered becasue he would be working in the lab. so it really depends upon the field of activity.

			<RelCText>Hi;Canadian Luda Moving to Qatar in mid-August is a no no.But if you have no choice...Why do I say that??Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it. Regarding the shipment;there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here(house-holds;china;etc)at a reasonable price. Visa-it depends on how fast the company you will be working for is. What to expect when you arrive??hhhmm...difficult question.A lot of dust;heat and a lot of humidity :) I don't know how much you know about Qatar.But if you have any questions just let me know.

			<RelCText>tough time to move. I moved in August as well. but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on. Quick addition: I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together. clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house; pack a few boxes of clothes you want; pics; music or books or whatever. everything retail and consumable is expensive. As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place. Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that. I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs; marriage certs; etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them. Plus; if you can even get one of each certified by the Qatar consulate in Canada before you go (yo.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best</RelCText>

			<RelCText>aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You often find that when Megamart get something new in they slap a ridiculously high price on it in the hope that people will just buy it (which we often do; clearly). But I've quite often seen that a few weeks later the price is drastically reduced; sometimes halved; presumably because not enough people were buying it at the ridiculous price.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first of all you have to get your residence permit; afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license. if you already have a driving license from your country; take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it. no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school. if your license is from asia; it depends; but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test (signal; L and pocket parking; road test) or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>AL JAZEERA PURE DRINKING WATER is also the best. Their containers are all new. Their service staffs were polite. They have a timely deliveries so you wont worry wether you're out or still have spare containers left not consumed. They will only replenish your empty containers. No more to hurry for calling them at time you have water shortages. Besides; they are offering one(1) free standing Water Cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buying 2 booklet water coupons. At a cost of QAR1100.00 for 200pcs 5-gallon bottles; it's worth more than a service and the pure healthy water. I just had availed of it two weeks ago; i have a new cooler dispenser now. Call them at TEl: 4509555 Fax: 4509444 or email them at: info@aljazeerawater.com for more queries; simply call ANWAR HUSSAIN with mobile: 6191064 for additional info. I highly recommend AL JAZEErA WATER for you...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>yes; Hukk is right; nestle is not good with their service. infact; i came to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group. manhal does the filling for nestle; no wonder why they have such lousy service. to answer Mr.Vengal; i dont agree that manhal is the best; if u r using a dispenser with their bottle; you will be surprised to see red color plastic pieces inside the water tank and at times it is visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet. thats coz the red caps what they use on their bottles are not spill proof; when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser; the cap gets punctured and blows into pieces and it ends up in your water. i guess only rayyan and sabeel uses spill proof caps; and hence its safe.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>too bad you guys havent found Nestle reliable; ive been using them for 8 months and they have never failed.

			<RelQBody>Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Is pretty good on a Thursday night. Nice crowd of people and a good British band. Not clubbing though. For clubbing there is only the Pearl (with the awful DJ JoJO) and Cloud Nyn where the crowd is very very young. I guess if you want clubbing you really do have to go to Beirut.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with Tyler and bbksiu. Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi. So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Amaru Immortal - Clubs (I mean night clubs) here in Qatar are no comparison to what you'd find in a non-muslim country. They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. ""Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore. ""I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true?"" True. We go out on Thursdays. That's the weekend here. Happy hour starts at 5:30pm."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hi; I strongly recommend Evian. It's a bit more expensive than other water but it's worth it and you find it in all Carrefours. You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately...if you decide to go for another brand; make sure Sodium content is less than 20. We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian. My 5 year old was also on it when she was little. Also; what formula are you using? they are not always identical to UK ones. I tried Nestle's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now. I don't know if it's your first baby but in case it is - don't worry to much about what is so called ""recommended milk intake is"" - both my daughters always took at least 30% less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal. Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Maybe your grandson still adjusting with the situation and the weather here. Because it happened also to my baby when we were travelling. She didn`t drink her milk like before; but after few days everything is back to normal. And for the water i recommend Nestle; or Masafi. Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"""Bars in Doha (Starting from Garveys moving to Marriott)including drink prices; average nationality of customer; musical tastes and % of prostitutes. Garveys:(n.a.: closed) European family club. Cheapest drinks in Doha by far; usually a good (but *ahem* low class) crowd though 70% Male/British/Western/Rig Pigs; and 28% Female/British/Western or Filipina; 2% prostitute Usually a live band on Thursdays or Fridays; sometimes an Irish guy playing folky stuff on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. Average drink price 10 - 15 QR . Rugby Club: Similar to Garveys only maybe 60% British; not as many rig pigs and a lot more 16 year olds. Sometimes a DJ plays. Never seen any pros there either. Average drink price: 15QR . Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR . Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink pric....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Each year they publish a report detailing the minerals etc found in the tap water here. I have been here for 4+ years and it has always passed with flying colors and found safer than water in most American cities. I always use tap water for food preparation and have used it for drinking numerous times; although I prefer the taste of bottled water.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Apparently the water here is too hard and could damage the kidneys after a while. But this is what I heard; I'm not really sure if it is true. I'd rather play it safe and not drink tap water. I don't even give it to my cats. I guess I'm afraid of the vet bills : )</RelCText>
